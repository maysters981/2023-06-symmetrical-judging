# The `withdraw` function does not check if the user has enough balance

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
User can call the 'withdraw' function even if they have insufficient balance, leading to potential contract failure or unexpected behavior

## Impact
If the transaction ultimately fails due to insufficient balance, it would still consume gas, thus wasting network resources and incurring unnecessary costs for the user.
