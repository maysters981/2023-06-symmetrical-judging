# Party A can manipulate orderType to gain unfair advantages

## Summary

Party A can update the orderType from MARKET to LIMIT and vice versa at any time. This allows party A to exploit the order settlement logic such as force closing a position or preventing partial filling of an order.

## Vulnerability Detail

Party A can toggle the orderType from `MARKET` to `LIMIT` and `LIMIT` to `MARKET` to gain unfair advantages such as:

1. Force closing a position. (change from `MARKET` to `LIMIT`).

The `forceClosePosition` function is intended for party A to force close a `LIMIT` order in case party B does not agree to close the order.

        require(
            quote.orderType == OrderType.LIMIT,
            "PartyBFacet: Quote's order type should be LIMIT"
        );

However, party A can use this `forceClosePosition` to close a MARKET order as well by bypassing the check with the following steps:
- Call `requestToClosePosition` and change orderType to `LIMIT`. This is problematic because party A is allowed to change the order type even when the order is still `OPENED`.
        
        quote.orderType = orderType;

- Call `forceClosePosition` to close the order without party Bâ€™s consent after forceCloseCooldown time.

2. Prevent party B from partially filling a close request of a `LIMIT` order (change from `LIMIT` to `MARKET`).

        if (quote.orderType == OrderType.LIMIT) {
            require(quote.quantityToClose >= filledAmount, "PartyBFacet: Invalid filledAmount");
        } else {
            require(quote.quantityToClose == filledAmount, "PartyBFacet: Invalid filledAmount");
        }

## Impact

Party A can manipulate the order type and gain unfair advantages such as force closing a position and preventing party B from partially filling a close request.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do not allow party A to change the order type when calling `requestToClosePosition`.
