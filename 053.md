# Old price signature can be used to liquidate same user in future

## Summary
The current liquidation process presents a potential vulnerability where a user can be unfairly liquidated due to replaying of old price signatures. If a user becomes eligible for liquidation again after their initial liquidation, the liquidator can reuse an old price signature that marks a lower price, triggering an undue liquidation. This vulnerability could cause massive deficit accounting and disrupt the pNl accounting system.

## Vulnerability Detail
During user liquidations, price symbols are authenticated and validated by the MuonApp through the following Solidity code:
```solidity
        MAStorage.Layout storage maLayout = MAStorage.layout();
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();

        LibMuon.verifyPrices(priceSig, partyA);
        require(maLayout.liquidationStatus[partyA], "LiquidationFacet: PartyA is solvent");
        require(
            priceSig.timestamp <=
                maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
            "LiquidationFacet: Expired signature"
        );
```
In this procedure, the check against duplicate usage of the same signature is conducted in the second require statement. At the liquidation's completion, the `maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA]` is reset to zero. Therefore, if a liquidation is invoked again with the same signature, this require statement will fail.

However, an edge case emerges where the same signature can be reused if the user is liquidatable in some point future. Let's explore this through a scenario:

Suppose Alice is initially liquidated due to her long ETH position reaching her liquidation threshold price, marked at 1000$. The price signature now carries the ETH price as 1000$. Let's call this signature "x".

Fast forward six months, and the ETH price has risen to 4000$. Alice engages in more trades and opens a new long position from 4000$, setting her liquidation threshold at 3500$. When the price drops to 3500$, Alice becomes eligible for liquidation again. The liquidator updates the timestamp to `block.timestamp` upon calling the `liquidatePartyA` function. The liquidator then proceeds to call `setSymbolsPrice` but employs the old signature "x" from six months ago, which registered the ETH price as 1000$. As the existing checks assume the signature's validity, Alice is liquidated under the pretext that the ETH price has plummeted to 1000$, rather than 3500$.

This exploitation of replaying old signatures for prices could lead to substantial deficit accounting within the protocol and wreak havoc on the pNl accounting.
