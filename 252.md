# Deposit restriction can be bypassed

## Summary

The protocols only allowed whitelisted PartyB to deposit to its account. However, this restriction can be bypassed. If anyone could deposit funds into PartyB account, it would introduce all sorts of problems. For instance, a malicious user or competitor might intentionally inject ill-gotten gains or dirty funds into PartyB account in an attempt to cause indirect financial or reputational loss to the entities (e.g. being fined, blacklisted, or forced to shut down).

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol#L93

```solidity
File: AccountFacet.sol
93:     function depositForPartyB(uint256 amount) external whenNotPartyBActionsPaused onlyPartyB {
94:         AccountFacetImpl.depositForPartyB(amount);
95:         emit DepositForPartyB(msg.sender, amount);
96:     }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol#L74

```solidity
File: AccountFacet.sol
74:     function depositAndAllocateForPartyB(
75:         uint256 amount,
76:         address partyA
77:     ) external whenNotPartyBActionsPaused onlyPartyB {
78:         AccountFacetImpl.depositForPartyB(amount);
79:         AccountFacetImpl.allocateForPartyB(amount, partyA, true);
80:         emit DepositForPartyB(msg.sender, amount);
81:         emit AllocateForPartyB(msg.sender, partyA, amount);
82:     }
```

Based on the design of the protocol, only whitelisted PartyB can deposit to its account. The `onlyPartyB` modifer in the `depositForPartyB` and `depositAndAllocateForPartyB` will ensure that only whitelisted PartyBs can access these two functions.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/utils/Accessibility.sol#L13

```solidity
File: Accessibility.sol
13:     modifier onlyPartyB() {
14:         require(MAStorage.layout().partyBStatus[msg.sender], "Accessibility: Should be partyB");
15:         _;
16:     }
```

In addition, the use of `msg.sender` will ensure that authorized PartyB can only deposit into their own account. They cannot deposit to some other PartyB accounts.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L108

```solidity
File: AccountFacetImpl.sol
108:     function depositForPartyB(uint256 amount) internal {
109:         IERC20(GlobalAppStorage.layout().collateral).safeTransferFrom(
110:             msg.sender,
111:             address(this),
112:             amount
113:         );
114:         uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
115:         (10 ** IERC20Metadata(GlobalAppStorage.layout().collateral).decimals());
116:         AccountStorage.layout().balances[msg.sender] += amountWith18Decimals;
117:     }
```

However, all the above-mentioned restrictions can be bypassed. Since the underlying implementation of PartyA's `deposit` and PartyB's `depositForPartyB` functions are exactly the same, they can be used interchangeably. Anyone can call the permissionless `AccountFacet.deposit` function and set the `user` parameter to a PartyB address to deposit to any PartyB's account.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L19

```solidity
File: AccountFacetImpl.sol
19:     function deposit(address user, uint256 amount) internal {
20:         GlobalAppStorage.Layout storage appLayout = GlobalAppStorage.layout();
21:         IERC20(appLayout.collateral).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
22:         uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
23:         (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());
24:         AccountStorage.layout().balances[user] += amountWith18Decimals;
25:     }
```

## Impact

Unauthorized users could deposit funds into any PartyB account. PartyB is usually a hedger that could possibly be a trading firm or traditional finance/CFD brokerages. These entities are usually subjected to some form of regulatory oversight. Thus, the influx and outflow of funds to their account must be managed carefully to ensure compliance with the regulatory requirements.

If anyone could deposit funds into PartyB account, it would introduce all sorts of problems. For instance, a malicious user or competitor might intentionally inject ill-gotten gains or dirty funds into PartyB account in an attempt to cause indirect financial or reputational loss to the entities (e.g. being fined, bad PR, blacklisted, or forced to shut down).

## Recommendation

Ensure that no one can use the permissionless PartyA's `deposit` function to deposit funds to PartyB account.

```diff
function deposit(address user, uint256 amount) internal {
+	require(!MAStorage.layout().partyBStatus[user], "Cannot deposit into PartyB");
    GlobalAppStorage.Layout storage appLayout = GlobalAppStorage.layout();
    IERC20(appLayout.collateral).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
    (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());
    AccountStorage.layout().balances[user] += amountWith18Decimals;
}
