# User account and its funds got stuck in liquidation phase

## Summary
If liquidator starts the liquidation process but not continue within possible timeframe (before liquidationTimeout has passed) user account will stuck in liquidation position with its funds locked. This is true for both partyA and partyB.
## Vulnerability Detail
Liquidation occurs with multiple functions (4 with partyA and 2 with partyB). Let's start with partyA's liquidation process.
First, liquidator calls [liquidatePartyA](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol/#L20-L32) providing a signature and partyA address, and states that this address is insolvent with this uPNL at this timestamp.
```solidity
    function liquidatePartyA(address partyA, SingleUpnlSig memory upnlSig) internal {
        MAStorage.Layout storage maLayout = MAStorage.layout();

        LibMuon.verifyPartyAUpnl(upnlSig, partyA);
        int256 availableBalance = LibAccount.partyAAvailableBalanceForLiquidation(
            upnlSig.upnl,
            partyA
        );
        require(availableBalance < 0, "LiquidationFacet: PartyA is solvent");
        maLayout.liquidationStatus[partyA] = true;
        maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA] = upnlSig.timestamp;
        AccountStorage.layout().liquidators[partyA].push(msg.sender);
    }
```
As can be seen from the function, user account will be flagged as liquidateable and at this stage, the user account is frozen. Also at this stage ```maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA]``` has been set to the  ```upnlSig.timestamp```. When partyA's liquidation status is true, partyA literally can not do anything with their positions (e.g. can not close their position and get their money back), and can not open any positions.
That means right now the account is completely frozen with it funds and only way to unlock is through liquidators. Only way to make liquidation statues of partyA to false is in function [liquidatePositionsPartyA](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol/#L126-L238). 
In here we can see that after liquidation process is done, the status will set back to false:
```solidity
maLayout.liquidationStatus[partyA] = false;
```
In order to call this function, liquidator first needs to call ```setSymbolsPrice``` function as can be seen with this require state:
```solidity
require(
                accountLayout.symbolsPrices[partyA][quote.symbolId].timestamp ==
                    maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA],
                "LiquidationFacet: Price should be set"
            );
```
So far it seems good because that was the required steps to liquidate partyA, but the problem comes in [setSymbolsPrice](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol/#L34-L97) function. Here we can see that this function can only be called after ```liquidatePartyA``` called and timestamp set, and before ```liquidationTimeout``` passed:
```solidity
 require(
            priceSig.timestamp <=
                maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
            "LiquidationFacet: Expired signature"
        );
```
(For extra information, liquidationTimeout automatically set to the 600 seconds in ```ControlFacet.sol```)
That means if liquidator don't call ```setSymbolsPrice``` function before required time (600 seconds in default) it won't be callable again ever and also all other functions regarding partyA will be locked because ```liquidationStatus``` stucked at ```true```. Hence account will be frozen with its positions and funds.
Same situation occurs for partyB too. Although there are only two functions to liquidate PartyB, again [liquidatePartyB](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol/#L240-L306) locks partyB's situation to true and again set liquidationtimestamp. In the second function [liquidatePositionsPartyB](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol/#L308-L383) we have liquidationTimeout check and if this fails it's not possible to convert the liquidationStatus of PartyB against PartyA to false. Code for partyB:
```solidity
maLayout.partyBLiquidationStatus[partyB][partyA] = true;
maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] = upnlSig.timestamp;
```
```solidity
require(
            priceSig.timestamp <=
                maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
            "LiquidationFacet: Expired signature"
        );
...
if (quoteLayout.partyBPositionsCount[partyB][partyA] == 0) {
            maLayout.partyBLiquidationStatus[partyB][partyA] = false;
            maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] = 0;
```
## Impact
Account is frozen with all its positions and funds, and it's not recoverable. Hence both partyA and partyB is losing all of their funds regarding to these positions.

## Recommendation
One possible solution is:
You can make it possible such that if user is not liquidated within given timeframe, liquidation status of user's account set to false again in order for other liquidators to start liquidation process again.
