# setSymbolsPrice can be repeatedly called during the 4-step liquidation process

## Summary
setSymbolsPrice can be repeatedly called during the 4-step liquidation process

## Vulnerability Detail
According to documentation, liquidation is a 4-step process, namely:
1. liquidatePartyA
2. setSymbolsPrice
3. liquidatePendingPositionsPartA
4. liquidatePositionsPartyA

During setSymbolsPrice, the caller would push his/her addresses on the list of liquidators, and this list of liquidators would get liquidation fee(lf) at the end of `liquidatePositionPartyA`. However this setSymbolsPrice could be repeated called, even though a liquidator has initiated it. 

PoC:

Common.ts
```nodejs
export async function liquidatePartyA(
  context: RunContext,
  liquidatedUser: Promise<string>,
  liquidator: SignerWithAddress = context.signers.liquidator,
  upnl: BigNumberish = decimal(-473),
  totalUnrealizedLoss: BigNumberish = 0,
  symbolIds: BigNumberish[] = [1],
  prices: BigNumberish[] = [decimal(1)],
) {
  await context.liquidationFacet
    .connect(liquidator)
    .liquidatePartyA(liquidatedUser, await getDummySingleUpnlSig(upnl));
  
  await context.liquidationFacet
    .connect(context.signers.admin)
    .setSymbolsPrice(
      liquidatedUser,
      await getDummyPriceSig(symbolIds, prices, upnl, totalUnrealizedLoss),
    );
    await context.liquidationFacet
    .connect(liquidator)
    .setSymbolsPrice(
      liquidatedUser,
      await getDummyPriceSig(symbolIds, prices, upnl, totalUnrealizedLoss),
    );
}
```

The result:
```nodejs
 1) UnitTests
       Liquidation
         Liquidate PartyA
           Liquidate Positions
             Should liquidate positions:

      AssertionError: expected 500000000000000000 to equal 1000000000000000000. The numerical values of the given "ethers.BigNumber" and "ethers.BigNumber" inputs were compared, and they differed.
```

This cause MEV problem and a liquidator might NOT be incentivised to complete the liquidation if there is too many liquidators to split the `lf` for the same liquidation call, before he/she completes the 4-step process.


## Impact
part of the 4-step liquidation process(setSymbolPrice) can be bundled into MEV too; and liquidator's liquidation reward would be split.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider make the `setSymbolsPrice` atomic and one-off for a particular liquidation process, if the second caller does not do any meaningful change on the data structure.
