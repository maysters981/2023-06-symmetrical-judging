# underflows could occur in case deficit is bigger than totalUnrealizedLoss during OVERDUE liquidation at setSymbolsPrice

## Summary
underflows occurs in case deficit is bigger than totalUnrealizedLoss during OVERDUE liquidation at `setSymbolsPrice`
## Vulnerability Detail
During OVERDUE liquidation, `partyBAllocatedBalances[[quote.partyB][partyA]` would receive the lftover of the position, after deducing the deficit as a ratio of totalUnrealizedLoss. 

However if deficit is bigger than totalUnrealizedLoss, the subtraction would underflows
`amount -
                        ((amount * accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].deficit) /
                            uint256(-accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].totalUnrealizedLoss));`

```solidity
else if (
                accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationType == LiquidationType.OVERDUE
            ) {
                if (hasMadeProfit) {
                    accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA] -= amount;
                } else {
                    accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA] +=
                        amount -
                        ((amount * accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].deficit) /
                            uint256(-accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].totalUnrealizedLoss));
                }
            }
```

calculation of deficit on OVERDUE liquidation
```solidity
else {
                uint256 deficit = uint256(-availableBalance) -
                    accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].lf -
                    accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].cva;
                accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationType = LiquidationType.OVERDUE;
                accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].deficit = deficit;
            }
            AccountStorage.layout().liquidators[partyA].push(msg.sender);

Since `totalUnrealizedLoss` is passed by gateway, there is no bound over `deficit` would be less than totalUnrealizedLoss.

```solidity
        if (accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationType == LiquidationType.NONE) {
            accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA] = LiquidationDetail({
                liquidationType: LiquidationType.NONE,
                upnl: priceSig.upnl,
                totalUnrealizedLoss: priceSig.totalUnrealizedLoss,
                deficit: 0,
                liquidationFee: 0
            })
```
## Impact
OVERDUE liquidation reverts when deficit is bigger than totalUnrealizedLoss.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider putting a floor on deficit as `min(totalUnrealizedLoss, accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].deficit)`
