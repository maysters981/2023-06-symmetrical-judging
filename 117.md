# Some liquidations will not be attractive for liquidators

## Summary
Some liquidations will not be attractive for liquidators. This is because they don't pay anything for the job.
## Vulnerability Detail
It's possible that pnl of user will be bigger then total `lf` provided. That actually means that protocol will not pay liquidator for the job.
You can see it [for partyA](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L73-L87) and also [for partyB](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L268-L270).

In this case liquidators will not be incentivized to do liquidation, because it's not profitable for them, so position can continue being liquidatable and losing value, till it will be insolvent.
## Impact
Positions will not be liquidated, when they should and will be insolvent.
