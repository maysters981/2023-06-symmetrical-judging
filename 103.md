# There is no way to withdraw ether received directly into diamond contract

## Summary
In order to differentiate the call on the diamond contract as fund transfer or a call on function with data, a receive was explicitly declared.  This ensures that calls made to diamond with fund transfer alone does not enter the fallback function, but there is no way to refund the ether received directly.  

## Vulnerability Detail
Locked ether. Someone can send ether directly to diamond contract and the ether is locked as there is no mechanism to withdraw ether.

Assuming diamond proxy pattern can add new functionality incrementally in future and adds a business contract to transfer funds, how will it deal with funds received until that point.

## Impact
As there is no provision to withdraw funds, the funds are locked in the diamond contract.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/Diamond.sol#L12-L13

```solidity
contract Diamond {
    receive() external payable {}

    constructor(address _contractOwner, address _diamondCutFacet) payable {
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since the intention for declaring receive was to differentiate between fund transfer and call on a function, the recommendation to to revert in receive() so that funds are not deposited in the proxy contract.

```solidity
contract Diamond {
    receive() external payable {
    revert("Not supported"); 
    }
```

Using revert also ensures that the gas is refunded to the caller.
