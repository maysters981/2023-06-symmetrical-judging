# partyA or partyB can be unexpectedly liquidated immediately after opening position if low LIMIT price is provided in the quote

## Summary

Balances locked for partyA and partyB when opening new LIMIT position are scaled by the difference between LIMIT `price` (`quote.requestedOpenPrice`) and `openPrice`:

There is also no check of either party becoming liquidatable after this change to locked balances (as it's one of the last actions in the `openPosition` function). This means that either or both parties can become liquidatable right after `openPosition` due to increased locked balances, which can be abused by either party to immediately liquidate the other one if low LIMIT `price` is specified in the quote.

## Vulnerability Detail

When partyA sends a quote, it specifies `cva`, `lf` and `mm` values, which are locked from the allocated balance. When partyB locks the quote, the same values are locked from the allocated balance for partyB. But when position is opened, these pending locked values are scaled by the difference between `openPrice` and `requestedOpenPrice`. If `requestedOpenPrice` is much lower than current market price, then the locked balances are significantly increased without any check for the solvency of either party. For example, if current market price is $1 and partyA with $200 allocated balance sends a quote for short position with `cva+lf+mm = $100` and LIMIT price of $0.1, then `100` is locked after `sendQuote`, but it becomes `1000` after `openPosition` call, as it multiplies by `1 / 0.1 = 10` with partyA immediately becoming liquidatable. The same happens with partyB as well (locked balances increase from `100` to `1000`).

All of this happens if partyB fills 100% of partyA quote. If it fills less than 100% of partyA quote, then the filled balances are scaled too:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L184-L185

However, since filled balances are subtracted from initial balances, large disparencies between `openPrice` and `requestedOpenPrice` can lead to subtraction overflow and the transaction simply reverts.

## Impact

Malicious partyA can send a SHORT quote with LIMIT price much lower than current market price. When partyB opens position, partyA immediately liquidates unsuspecting partyB (as it didn't expect for locked balances to grow that much), effectively stealing partyB's deposited funds.

The same can also happen the other way (unsuspecting partyA opening SHORT position and getting liquidated immediately, losing deposited funds for no reason).

## Code Snippet

Add this to any test, for example to `ClosePosition.behavior.ts`

```ts
  it("Unexpected liquidation", async function () {
    const context: RunContext = this.context;

    this.user_allocated = decimal(1000);
    this.hedger_allocated = decimal(300);

    this.user = new User(this.context, this.context.signers.user);
    await this.user.setup();
    await this.user.setBalances(this.user_allocated, this.user_allocated, this.user_allocated);

    this.hedger = new Hedger(this.context, this.context.signers.hedger);
    await this.hedger.setup();
    await this.hedger.setBalances(this.hedger_allocated, this.hedger_allocated);

    this.liquidator = new User(this.context, this.context.signers.liquidator);
    await this.liquidator.setup();

    // Quote1 SHORT opened
    await this.user.sendQuote(limitQuoteRequestBuilder().positionType(PositionType.SHORT).quantity(decimal(500)).price(decimal(2, 17)).build());
    await this.hedger.lockQuote(1);

    var info = await context.viewFacet.balanceInfoOfPartyB(this.hedger.signer.address, this.user.signer.address);
    console.log("PartyB pendingLockedBalances.total() after lockQuote: " + info[8]/1e18);

    await this.hedger.openPosition(1, limitOpenRequestBuilder().filledAmount(decimal(500)).build());

    info = await context.viewFacet.balanceInfoOfPartyB(this.hedger.signer.address, this.user.signer.address);
    console.log("PartyB lockedBalances.total() after openPosition: " + info[4]/1e18);

    await context.liquidationFacet.liquidatePartyB(
      this.hedger.signer.address,
      this.user.signer.address,
      await getDummySingleUpnlSig(decimal(0)),
    );

    var liquidated = await context.viewFacet.isPartyBLiquidated(this.hedger.signer.address, this.user.signer.address);
    console.log("PartyB Liquidated: " + liquidated);
  });
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The core problem is that normally (in the other derivatives exchanges, both CEX and DEX), these locked balances (usually called maintaince and initial margin) are percentages based on current market price, rather than absolute fixed values. So it's up to team's preference how to fix it and how they want these locked balances to behave. I can suggest 2 options:

1. Quick fix - either don't scale locked balances at all, or scale them based on openPrice vs market price at the quote submission time (rather than price provided by user), but make the user aware that these locked balances can change. Also, add solvency check for partyA and partyB after applying new (scaled) balances.

2. Make it consistent with industry standard and make cva, lf and mm values percentages of current notional, rather than absolute values. This will make things harder, because solvency check will now require both total unrealized pnl and total balances locked calculation signed, since it won't be able to calculate all current locked balances.
