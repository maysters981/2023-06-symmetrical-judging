# Trading fee accounting can cause users to be unable to cancel or expire quotes

## Summary

Users can be blocked from cancelling or expiring quotes if the protocol's `feeCollector` admin withdraws trading fees or is changed to an account that has no `AccountStorage.layout().balance[feeCollector]` value in the system yet. This is against spec and can cause damages to users who are unable to cancel quote during price swings.

## Vulnerability Detail

This is due to incorrectly assuming that the trading fees for a quote will remain in the system for the duration of a quote's lifecycle. Currently the fees can become inaccessible during a quote's lifecycle.  

In the codebase, trading fees are taken immediately in `PartyAFacetImpl:sendQuote()` via LibQuote.sol's [`receiveTradingFee()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/6d2b64b6732fcfbd07c8217897dd233dbb6cd1f5/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibQuote.sol#L146) function where the project's `feeCollector` top level balance account gets increased directly:
```solidity
 accountLayout.balances[GlobalAppStorage.layout().feeCollector] += tradingFee; 
```
Then, if a quote is cancelled or expires, the trading fees are reversely directly reduced in  LibQuote.sol's [`returnTradingFee()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/6d2b64b6732fcfbd07c8217897dd233dbb6cd1f5/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibQuote.sol#L139):
```solidity
 function returnTradingFee(uint256 quoteId) internal {
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        uint256 tradingFee = LibQuote.getTradingFee(quoteId);
        accountLayout.allocatedBalances[QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId].partyA] += tradingFee;
        accountLayout.balances[GlobalAppStorage.layout().feeCollector] -= tradingFee;
    }
```
The issue is that the protocol's `feeCollector` can withdraw the trading fees (or be changed to a new account with no balance), resulting in the attempted reduction of the `feeCollector`'s balance to revert with underflow error. The result is users being unable to close or expire quotes until other users have paid more fees into the system by opening new quotes.

## Impact

Users can be unable to cancel or expire quotes that they should be. This can hurt users if they are unable to cancel pending quotes during a price swing.

## Code Snippet

Add this test case to CancelQuote.behavior.ts:
```typescript
  it.only("Will panic when trying to cancel quote", async function () {
    const context: RunContext = this.context;
    const validator = new CancelQuoteValidator();
    const beforeOut = await validator.before(context, {
      user: this.user,
      quoteId: BigNumber.from(1),
    });

    // change the fee collector to an account with zero balance 
    await context.controlFacet
      .connect(context.signers.admin)
      .setFeeCollector(context.collateral.address); 

    // this will now panic
    await expect(this.user.requestToCancelQuote(1)).to.be.revertedWithPanic(0x11);
  });
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Do not pay out trading fees until the quote has been filled!
