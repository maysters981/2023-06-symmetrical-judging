# If the fee collector is PartyA  in function `receiveTradingFee` then they will get out trading fees which goes against the supposed spec of the system

## Summary
The FeeCollector 
## Vulnerability Detail
The spec  in the system should be that PartyA should pay funding fees to the protocol
but in `receiveTradingFee` they don't 
```solidity
     uint256 tradingFee = LibQuote.getTradingFee(quoteId);
        accountLayout.allocatedBalances[QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId].partyA] -= tradingFee;
        accountLayout.balances[GlobalAppStorage.layout().feeCollector] += tradingFee;
```
Note:
 The fee collector is set  not explicitly trusted in The Readme but  the fee collector address is set by the `setter` Role we can't assume that it's trusted/not compromised 
## Impact
steps:
1. Fc(feeCollector) makes a huge position with big `requstedopenedPrice` and should pay a huge fee 
2. since they are PartyA they don't pay for it 
3. They take the pnl and close the position (they can do these many times and get out fees)
the loss of funds for the protocol can be substantial 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
     uint256 tradingFee = LibQuote.getTradingFee(quoteId);
        account layout.allocatedBalances[QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId].partyA] -= tradingFee;
        accountLayout.balances[GlobalAppStorage.layout().feeCollector] += tradingFee;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Do an extra validation in `recieveTradingFee`  that if its FeeCollector the fee goes to the Admin 
```solidity

if (PartyA!=FeeCollector){
	 accountLayout.balances[GlobalAppStorage.layout().feeCollector] += tradingFee;
}
 accountLayout.balances[GlobalAppStorage.layout().Admin] += tradingFee;
```
