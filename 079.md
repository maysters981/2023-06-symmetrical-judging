# A party B can open a short position for a limit quote in a way which makes party A liquidatable

## Summary
A party B can open a position in a way which makes belonging party A liquidatable

## Vulnerability Detail
We can see that a check is used before opening a position in order to ensure that opening a position makes neither A nor B liquidatable:

However in the case of a `SHORT` `limit` position, it only ensures that unrealized pnl of the position does not make it unsolvent:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibSolvency.sol#L71C1-L82

In the case of a `SHORT`, the higher the opening price compared to actual price, the higher the positive pnl for A, so it should not revert here.

However we also see that the amount to lock is scaled accordingly in the opening position logic:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L162-L164

Which means that the higher opening price partyB chooses for the opening of the position, the higher the amount which will be locked by both parties as a collateral.

Even if the lockedAmount may be way larger than anticipated by partyA, this does not make it necessarily liquidatable because the position may be counter-balanced by the positive uPnL if `actual price` (oracle price) is lower than `opening price`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibAccount.sol#L78-L86

The issue arises however in the case: 

requestedOpenPrice << actualPrice
and actualPrice == openPrice

Since there is no restriction on the requestedOpeningPrice when sending a quote, two cases may arise:
- partyA intentionally creates a liquidatable position by choosing a very low `requestedOpenPrice` for a short quote.
- partyA creates a long lived quote and actual price drifts too high compared to `requestedOpenPrice`.

The solvency check should prevent A from being liquidated due to locking an amount too high.

## Impact
partyA can be made to take a leverage too large during opening of short position by partyB and lose funds.

## Recommendation
Adapt solvency check to take in account actual locked funds scaled by opening price
