# Incorrect accounting of the deadline can create expired quotes with an OPENED status.

## Summary

During the execution of the functions requestToClosePosition() and requestToCancelCloseRequest(), several changes in the deadline parameter can cause the appearance of expired quotes with an OPENED status.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's see the requestToClosePosition() function and some explanation from the readme file: 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L148-L155

> deadline: This parameter is a lot like the one in 'sendQuote'. Basically, if 'partyB' doesn't get back to the request within a certain time, then the request will just time out

So it means that it's a deadline for the exact request, not for the whole quote. But during execution, this deadline parameter saves in quote.deadline changing the deadline for the whole quote:

## Impact

## Code Snippet

Let's change some default test variables:

QuoteRequest.ts:

    const limitDefaultQuoteRequest: QuoteRequest = {
    partyBWhiteList: [],
    symbolId: 1,
    positionType: PositionType.LONG,
    orderType: OrderType.LIMIT,
    price: decimal(1),
    quantity: decimal(100),
    cva: decimal(22),
    mm: decimal(75),
    lf: decimal(3),
    maxInterestRate: 0,
    deadline: getBlockTimestamp(10000), // deadline that user set up for the quote is 10000
    upnlSig: getDummySingleUpnlAndPriceSig(decimal(1)),
   };

CloseRequest.TS: 

    const limitDefaultCloseRequest: CloseRequest = {
    quantityToClose: decimal(100),
    closePrice: decimal(1),
    price: decimal(1),
    upnl: "0",
    orderType: OrderType.LIMIT,
    deadline: getBlockTimestamp(5000), // deadline for the request is 5000 as I think that a user wants to close the position earlier than the quote's deadline
};

I used the following test from the ClosePosition.Behaviour.ts to show the expected scenario of events.

    it.only("Should expire request", async function () {
      const context: RunContext = this.context;
      await time.increase(7500); 
      await this.user.requestToCancelCloseRequest(1);  //request at 7500 to cancel after the new deadline 5000
      expect((await context.viewFacet.getQuote(1)).quoteStatus).to.be.equal(QuoteStatus.OPENED);
    });

I added console.log to the contracts to see the difference:

PartyAFacetImpl.sol:

    195: function requestToCancelCloseRequest(uint256 quoteId) internal returns (QuoteStatus) {
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        Quote storage quote = QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId];

        require(quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.CLOSE_PENDING, "PartyAFacet: Invalid state");
        if (block.timestamp > quote.deadline) {
            LibQuote.expireQuote(quoteId); 
            console.log("quote.deadline after requestToCancelCloseRequest with Opened Status",quote.deadline);
            console.log("block.timestamp",block.timestamp);
            return QuoteStatus.OPENED;
        }

Console.log:

    quote.deadline after requestToCancelCloseRequest with Opened Status 168728_6327
    block.timestamp 168728_8879

As you can see we now have a quote with OPENED status and quote.deadline from the past.

To see an impact take a look at the function requestToClosePosition():

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L160-L161

If the user wants to close his position in the future he won't pass the require check.



## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a separate variable for the request deadline.
