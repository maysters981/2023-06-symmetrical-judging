# After the liquidation timeout, the corresponding trading is locked forever.

## Summary
Currently in liquidation, it will determine whether `priceSig.timestamp` is time out `liquidationTimeout`.
If it's time out, it cannot be liquidated.
But there is no remedy so if for some reason the liquidation expires and the `priceSig` within the legal time range cannot be obtained
Then the corresponding transaction will be locked and no funds can be retrieved.

## Vulnerability Detail

in liquidation, will check `priceSig.timestamp`

```solidity
    function liquidatePositionsPartyB(
        address partyB,
        address partyA,
        QuotePriceSig memory priceSig
    ) internal {
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        MAStorage.Layout storage maLayout = MAStorage.layout();
        QuoteStorage.Layout storage quoteLayout = QuoteStorage.layout();

        LibMuon.verifyQuotePrices(priceSig);
        require(
@>          priceSig.timestamp <=
                maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
            "LiquidationFacet: Expired signature"
        );
        require(
            maLayout.partyBLiquidationStatus[partyB][partyA],
            "LiquidationFacet: PartyB is solvent"
        );
        require(
@>          block.timestamp <= priceSig.timestamp + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
            "LiquidationFacet: Expired price sig"
        );
```


If a user executes `liquidatePartyB()`, modify `maLayout.partyBLiquidationStatus[partyB][partyA] = true`
The current protocol default is `maLayout.liquidationTimeout = 600;`

There may be the following reasons for missing the `priceSig` for getting a legal time range

1. user maliciously does not request `priceSig` , Cause time has passed
2. if partyBPositionLiquidatorsShare[partyB][partyA] ==0ï¼Œ other liquidators have no incentive to call this method
3. Muon failure  during this time
4. chainLink failure  during this time
... .etc

Due to time constraints, the subsequent execution of `liquidatePositionsPartyB()` could not be successfully executed again

and there is no remedy in the current protocol, for example, the administrator can reset `partyBLiquidationTimestamp.[partyB][partyA]`

The trade will be locked forever

## Impact
 trading may be locked forever.
`accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA]` The corresponding lockedValues cannot be reduced

add the administrator can reset `partyBLiquidationTimestamp.[partyB][partyA]`
