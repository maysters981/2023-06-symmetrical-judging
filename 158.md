# partyB can dodge liquidation if partyA gets liquidated first

## Summary
partyA liquidation will save the partyB's liquidation status.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the event that both partyA and partyB are eligible for liquidation and linked via quotes, the liquidation of partyA will inherently trigger the liquidation process for partyB. As partyA undergoes liquidation, all associated quotes are effectively closed and finalized. As a consequence of this chain reaction, partyB effectively sidesteps its impending liquidation.

## Impact
Since partyA can have multiple quotes with different partyB's, partyA can get liquidated easier than a partyB in general. Also, if one of the positions of partyB can be liquidated it would mean the counterparty A is winning, however, that doesn't mean that the partyA is also liquidatable.
