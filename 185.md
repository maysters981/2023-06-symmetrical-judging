# No check for expired `priceSig` in `setSymbolsPrice`

## Summary

The `setSymbolsPrice` function of the `LiquidationFacetImpl` library does not check if the `priceSig` is too old. This can result in the wrong uPnL, total unrealized loss and symbol prices being used in the liquidation process.

## Vulnerability Detail

The liquidation process of a party A consists of 4 steps where a liquidator calls `liquidatePartyA`, `setSymbolsPrice`, `liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA` and `liquidatePositionsPartyA` functions of the library `LiquidationFacetImpl`.

The issue is that in the `setSymbolsPrice` there is no verification for the `priceSig` being too old. Note also that there is no check in `LibMuon:verifyPrices` function for party A nonce, so any previous valid signature for party A can be used.

Notice also that once the `liquidationType` for party A has been set, new calls to the `setSymbolsPrice` will revert if the `priceSig.upnl` and `priceSig.totalUnrealizedLoss` are not equal to the ones used in the first call. So even if an honest liquidator tried to update the liquidation data, it will fail.

## Impact

A malicious liquidator can use an outdated signature which will result in the wrong uPnL, total unrealized loss and symbol prices being used in the liquidation process. This can result in party A being liquidated for a smaller or bigger amount than it should be.

Another possible impact is that the `priceSig` does not include all the symbols that party A has positions in, because it was signed before party A created the current quotes. This can result in the liquidation process not being able to liquidate all the positions of party A and getting stuck forever.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a check for the `priceSig` being too old in either `LiquidationFacetImpl:setSymbolsPrice` or `LibMuon:verifyPrices` functions.

```solidity
require(
    block.timestamp <= priceSig.timestamp + muonLayout.priceValidTime,
    "LibMuon: Expired signature"
);
```
