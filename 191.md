# Position can fall below minimum acceptable quote value after partial closing

## Summary

The remaining quote value is not checked when a partial cancellation of a position in the `CANCEL_CLOSE_PENDING` status is requested, which might lead to a situation where the remaining quote value is too low.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol has a minimum acceptable quote value that tries to prevent the existence of quotes or positions with a value that is too small, which might descent into situations where there is no economic incentive to act on the position.

When creating a new quote, opening a position, requesting to close a position or closing a position, it is checked that the remaining quote value is not too low. However, when a partial cancellation of a position in the `CANCEL_CLOSE_PENDING` status is requested, the remaining quote value is not checked, which might lead to a situation where the remaining quote value is too low.

## Impact

The remaining quote value might be too low, which might lead to a situation where there is no economic incentive to act on the position, creating a loss of funds for the user.

        ) {
            quote.quoteStatus = QuoteStatus.OPENED;
            quote.requestedClosePrice = 0;
            quote.quantityToClose = 0; // for CANCEL_CLOSE_PENDING status
-       } else {
+       }
+       if (quote.closedAmount != quote.quantity && quote.quantityToClose > 0) {
            require(
                quote.lockedValues.total() >=
                    SymbolStorage.layout().symbols[quote.symbolId].minAcceptableQuoteValue,
                "LibQuote: Remaining quote value is low"
