# The isValid of Symbol should be checked in subsequent operations.

## Summary
The `isValid` of Symbol should be checked in subsequent operations.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `isValid` of Symbol can be set through `setSymbolValidationState`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/control/ControlFacet.sol#L136-L144
```solidity
    function setSymbolValidationState(
        uint256 symbolId,
        bool isValid
    ) external onlyRole(LibAccessibility.SYMBOL_MANAGER_ROLE) {
        SymbolStorage.Layout storage symbolLayout = SymbolStorage.layout();
        require(symbolId >= 1 && symbolId <= symbolLayout.lastId, "ControlFacet: Invalid id");
        emit SetSymbolValidationState(symbolId, symbolLayout.symbols[symbolId].isValid, isValid);
        symbolLayout.symbols[symbolId].isValid = isValid;
    }
```

`isValid` is checked in `sendQuote`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L44
```solidity
require(symbolLayout.symbols[symbolId].isValid, "PartyAFacet: Symbol is not valid");
```

But there is no check in subsequent operations such as `lockQuote`.

This means that if the symbol is no longer valid after `sendQuote`, subsequent operations can still be carried out regardless of the influence of `isValid`.
## Impact
If the symbol is no longer valid after `sendQuote`, subsequent operations can still be carried out regardless of the influence of `isValid`.
