# PartyAFacetImpl.sendQuote doesn't have slippage protection

## Summary
PartyAFacetImpl.sendQuote doesn't have slippage protection. Because of that in case if prices will change, then user will need to provide quote.
## Vulnerability Detail
When user creates quote then he provides price that he wants to get.
partyB can close this order [only with better price](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L136-L146).

This means that in case if prices will change in worse side for user, then partyB will not be able to open position with worse price.
As result user will need to cancel this position and open new one with lower expected prices. This will cost gas for him.

User should be able to provide `slippage` param, which can be used to allow trades with worse price.
## Impact
User order will not be executed by partyB and he needs no provide new one.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add slippage param to the quote, this param will allow partyB to provide worse price, but not worse than slippage.
