# If partyB is suspended, partyB still can withdraw the stablecoins

## Summary
Suspended partyBs' are not allowed to withdraw funds from the protocol. However, there are few ways for suspended partyB's to avoid suspension and withdraw the funds out of the contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
PartyB that's suspended can withdraw its balance from the contracts in few ways.

1- Profit
Let's consider a situation where a user (partyB) is suspended, unable to withdraw any stablecoin from the protocol contracts, with a total of 1.01M balance tied up in the system.  PartyB then creates a new account, funds it with 1.01M, making the new account partyA. This newly created account now has the ability to deposit and allocate stablecoins within the protocol. PartyA proceeds to establish a LONG, LIMIT position, setting the opening price at 2000$ and supports it with the 1.01M funds. PartyB (the suspended account) then locks this position and opens it. Immediately after this, partyA places a close request at a price of 4000$ and instantly closes it using the partyB account. This maneuver leads to a profit of 1M for the partyA, leaving the partyB account depleted, but with partyA now in possession of the funds. PartyA can swiftly deallocate and withdraw these funds, effectively circumventing the suspension.

2- Liquidation
In a similar setting, a locked account (partyB) with 1.01M balance creates a new account, essentially forming partyA. PartyA then initiates a SHORT, LIMIT position with an open price of 2000$, backing it with the 1.01M funds. This includes 1M for cva, 0 for mm, and 1000 for lf, assuming the minimum lf portion of 0.1%.

Remember, both partyB and partyA are operated by the same entity.

Next, the locked partyB account opens this quote at the stipulated price. This action results in an immediate vulnerability for both partyA and partyB to be liquidated following even a minuscule price shift. The protocol's internal function, 'partyBAvailableBalanceForLiquidation,' assesses the situation and determines the potential amount for liquidation by subtracting the cva and lf from the allocated balances of partyB.

```solidity
function partyBAvailableBalanceForLiquidation(
        int256 upnl,
        address partyB,
        address partyA
    ) internal view returns (int256) {
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        int256 a = int256(accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[partyB][partyA]) -
            int256(
                accountLayout.partyBLockedBalances[partyB][partyA].cva +
                    accountLayout.partyBLockedBalances[partyB][partyA].lf
            );
        return a + upnl;
    }
```

If the price drops, partyB will face liquidation, and partyA will gain the 1M cva. As a result, partyA can immediately deallocate and withdraw the money from the system. In addition, if the liquidator role is public, partyA could also execute the liquidation and claim the 1K lf.

To ensure partyB (the locked account) gets liquidated instead of the new partyA account, partyA should strive to get a PairUpnlAndPriceSig where the price exactly matches 2000$. This ensures a smooth opening of the position. Then, if the current market price falls below 2000$ even by a minute fraction, the liquidation can proceed.

If partyB (suspended) fails to manage this, it won't cause any harm because the liquidated funds will revert back to partyB, which now holds 2.01M. Meaning, as long as a new partyA, operated by the suspended partyB, can acquire 2.01M, the process can be repeated.
## Impact
Since there is no way to pull the partyB status off for a specific partyB, there is no way for protocol to block partyB suspension.
