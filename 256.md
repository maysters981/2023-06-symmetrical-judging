# Wrong Implementation of `msgChallenge` in  verifySignature() in LibMuonV04ClientBase.sol

## Summary
The implementation of `msgChallenge` in  verifySignature() does not include `PKx` & `PKyp` while hashing. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The @dev comment at 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibMuonV04ClientBase.sol#L39-#L45 
clearly says that while calculating `msgChallenge` ,the hash should include `PKx` & `PKyp` in it .
On discussion with Sponsor team , it was confirmed that , there is need of `PKx` & `PKyp` in the hash of `msgChallenge`.
Checkout this Chainlink implementation of the same from where the MUON team had referenced the entire contract : 
https://github.com/smartcontractkit/chainlink/blob/bb214c5d7ec172de400a72a1d8851ff639c979d2/evm/v0.5/contracts/dev/SchnorrSECP256K1.sol#L121-#L125
## Impact
Might cause cryptographic issues due to lack of `PKx` & `PKyp` in hash & might increase the chances of signature replaying attack.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Checkout the Chainlink Reference and add `PKx` & `PKyp` in hash.
