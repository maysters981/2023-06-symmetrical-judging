# Liquidators can prevent users from making their positions healthy during an unpause

## Summary
The Symmetrical protocol has various paused states in which different operations are paused. The protocol operations can be unpaused by privileged accounts. But when this unpause happens the liquidators can frontrun and liquidate user positions before those users get a chance to make their positions healthy.

## Vulnerability Detail

The privileged addresses can pause the symmetrical protocol fully/partially using the pausability functions in ControlFacet. Once the protocol is paused all these operations cannot be done by users:

- deposit
- withdraw
- allocate
- deallocate
- sendQuote
- lockQuote
- openPositions
- liquidations
- etc

Though, real prices from oracles will surely move up or down during this paused period. If the oracle prices go down, the users won't be allowed to allocate more collateral to their positions or close their positions. Hence their positions will get under-collateralized (based upon real prices).

Once the protocol is unpaused the liquidators can front-run most users and liquidate their positions. Most users will not get a chance to make their position healthy.

This results in loss of funds for the users.

## Impact
By front-running any collateral allocation or position closure of a legitimate user which became under-collateralized during the paused state, the liquidator can unfairly liquidate user positions and collect liquidation profit as soon as the protocol is unpaused. This causes loss of funds to the user.

Also, on unpause, it is unlikely that any human users will be able to secure their positions before MEV/liquidation bots capture the available profit. Hence the loss is certain.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a grace period after unpausing during which liquidation remains blocked to allow users to avoid unfair liquidation by closing their positions or allocating additional collateral.
The protocol team can also think of any other way which mitigates the unfair liquidations of users.
