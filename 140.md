# both parties care about each other solvency on closing position

## Summary
Both parties agree to take risks in sending a quote and opening a position respectively. But parties care about each other solvency in the closing position.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function isSolventAfterClosePosition(
        uint256 quoteId,
        uint256 filledAmount,
        uint256 closedPrice,
        PairUpnlAndPriceSig memory upnlSig
    ) internal view returns (bool) {
        Quote storage quote = QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId];
        uint256 unlockedAmount = (filledAmount * (quote.lockedValues.cva + quote.lockedValues.lf)) /
            LibQuote.quoteOpenAmount(quote);

        int256 partyBAvailableBalance = LibAccount.partyBAvailableBalanceForLiquidation(
            upnlSig.upnlPartyB,
            quote.partyB,
            quote.partyA
        ) + int256(unlockedAmount);

        int256 partyAAvailableBalance = LibAccount.partyAAvailableBalanceForLiquidation(
            upnlSig.upnlPartyA,
            quote.partyA
        ) + int256(unlockedAmount);

I believe it's not fair for both parties that they cannot close a position when they can make a profit at the expense of the other party being insolvent when they both agreed to open a position and send a quote.
## Impact
Not fair for users who can make a profit thus losing funds to them
## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I believe there should be `isSolventAfterClosePositionForPartyA` `isSolventAfterClosePositionForPartyB` and put them inside `PartyAFacetImpl`, `PartyBFacetImpl` instead `isSolventAfterClosePosition` respectively so they will be able to make a profit at the expense of the other party becoming liquidate-able
