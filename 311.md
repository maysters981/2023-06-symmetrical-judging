# `AccountFacet.transferAllocation` is missing `notLiquidatedPartyB` modifier

## Summary
`AccountFacet.transferAllocation` is missing `notLiquidatedPartyB` modifier. Hence allows allocating funds towards a liquidated partyB-partyA pair.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `AccountFacet.allocateForPartyB` function has the `notLiquidatedPartyB` modifier. But that validation can be bypassed by calling `transferAllocation` function.

```solidity
    function allocateForPartyB(
        uint256 amount,
        address partyA
    ) public whenNotPartyBActionsPaused notLiquidatedPartyB(msg.sender, partyA) onlyPartyB {
        AccountFacetImpl.allocateForPartyB(amount, partyA, true);
        emit AllocateForPartyB(msg.sender, partyA, amount);
    }

    function transferAllocation(
        uint256 amount,
        address origin,
        address recipient,
        SingleUpnlSig memory upnlSig
    ) external whenNotPartyBActionsPaused {
        AccountFacetImpl.transferAllocation(amount, origin, recipient, upnlSig);
        emit TransferAllocation(amount, origin, recipient);
    }
```

## Impact
Using `transferAllocation` a partyB can allocate funds towards a liquidated partyB-partyA pair. This can severely impact liquidations as the allocated balance will get changed between the `liquidatePartyB` and `liquidatePositionsPartyB` functions.

## Recommendation
Consider adding the `notLiquidatedPartyB` modifier to the `AccountFacet.transferAllocation` function.
