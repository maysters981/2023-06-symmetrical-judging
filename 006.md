# Function `sendQuote` doesn't have any checks for input validation

## Summary
Function sendQuote doesn't have any checks for input validation

## Vulnerability Detail
The `sendQuote` function receives several parameters, such as an array of addresses (partyBsWhiteList), several uint256 values (symbolId, price, quantity, cva, mm, lf, maxInterestRate, deadline) etc..

These inputs could contain invalid or malicious values, such as zero-addresses in partyBsWhiteList, or excessive values in the uint256 parameters, which could lead to unexpected contract behavior.

Also, there's no check to ensure that `partyBsWhiteList` contains valid Ethereum addresses, or that price, quantity, and other parameters are within acceptable limits.

## Impact
An attacker could send invalid or malicious inputs to disrupt contract operation or manipulate state

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add checks for these inputs such as check if addresses in partyBsWhiteList are non-zero.
