# Unauthorized Role Assignment

## Summary

The `grantRole` and `setAdmin` functions in `ControlFacet.sol` are only guarded by the `onlyOwner` or `onlyRole` modifier. If an adversary gained control of an account with `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`, they would have the ability to grant any role to any address, potentially resulting in unauthorized control of critical functionalities.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `grantRole` and `setAdmin` functions assign roles to addresses without any further checks beyond the `onlyRole` or `onlyOwner` modifier. If the account with `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` is compromised, an attacker could grant themselves any role.

## Impact

The potential impact is full control of the smart contract functionalities by an attacker. The attacker could pause/unpause the contract, add/remove symbols, set fee collector, adjust liquidation timeout, among other administrative functionalities.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function setAdmin(address user) external onlyOwner {
    GlobalAppStorage.layout().hasRole[user][LibAccessibility.DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE] = true;
    emit RoleGranted(LibAccessibility.DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, user);
}

function grantRole(
    address user,
    bytes32 role
) external onlyRole(LibAccessibility.DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    GlobalAppStorage.layout().hasRole[user][role] = true;
    emit RoleGranted(role, user);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a multi-signature mechanism or a role-based access control system for these sensitive operations to limit the power of a single admin role.

## Proof Of Concept

An adversary with control of an account with `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` could execute:
```solidity
await contractInstance.grantRole(attacker_address, LibAccessibility.SETTER_ROLE);
```
Assigning themselves the `SETTER_ROLE`, giving them the ability to adjust critical parameters.
