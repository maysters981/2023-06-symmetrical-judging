# liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA can be called before setSymbolsPrice

## Summary
liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA can be called before setSymbolsPrice

## Vulnerability Detail
During liquidation of partyA, there are 4 steps namely
1. liquidatePartyA
2. setSymbolsPrice
3. liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA
4. liquidatePositionsPartyA

However, liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA can be called before setSymbolsPrice, since it only requires the liquidationStatus of partyA to be true, which is set at the 1st step `liquidatePartyA`

```solidity
    function liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA(address partyA) internal {
        QuoteStorage.Layout storage quoteLayout = QuoteStorage.layout();
        require(
            MAStorage.layout().liquidationStatus[partyA],
            "LiquidationFacet: PartyA is solvent"
        );
```


## Impact
liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA can be called before setSymbolsPrice, which is different from the specification

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider requiring price to be set at
```solidity
    function liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA(address partyA) internal {
+++ require(
+++                accountLayout.symbolsPrices[partyA][quote.symbolId].timestamp ==
+++                    maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA],
+++                "LiquidationFacet: Price should be set"
+++            );
```
