# Trading fee is not returned for un-opened positions whose partyB is getting liquidated.

## Summary
When a partyB gets liquidated for a particular partyA, all of partyA's pending positions are nullified but the trading fee is not returned. 

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `LiquidationFacetImpl.liquidatePartyB` function, all the LOCKED and CANCEL_PENDING positions of partyB with partyA are nullified (balances reduced, arrays popped, etc) but the already collected trading fee from partyA is not returned.

```solidity
        for (uint256 index = 0; index < pendingQuotes.length; ) {
            Quote storage quote = quoteLayout.quotes[pendingQuotes[index]];
            if (
                quote.partyB == partyB &&
                (quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.LOCKED ||
                    quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.CANCEL_PENDING)
            ) {
                accountLayout.pendingLockedBalances[partyA].subQuote(quote);

                pendingQuotes[index] = pendingQuotes[pendingQuotes.length - 1];
                pendingQuotes.pop();
                quote.quoteStatus = QuoteStatus.LIQUIDATED;
                quote.modifyTimestamp = block.timestamp;
            } else {
                index++;
            }
        }
```

## Impact
Scenario:
1. There are already existing opened positions between partyA and partyB.
2. PartyA sends one more quote for partyB, trading fee is collected from partyA.
3. PartyB locks the new quote sent by partyA.
4. Due to any possible reasons, partyB becomes eligible for liquidations.
5. PartyB's locked position with partyA gets liquidated.
6. But the respective partyA does not get his trading fee back. 

Due to this bug the partyA suffers loss of the trading fee amount which was originally collected by the protocol. As the partyA is managing his positions correctly (keeping his side of positions healthy), he should not bear any loss of funds. Ideally trading fee must be returned to partyA.

The impact of this bug is high (loss of funds for partyA) and likelyhood is also high (will happen on most partyB liquidations).

## Recommendation
Consider returning the originally collected trading fee to the partyA in the `liquidatePartyB` function.
