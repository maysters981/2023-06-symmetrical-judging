# Access Control: Suspended users can force close their own position.

## Summary

Malicious users are suspended from participation in the protocol through `setSuspendedAddress()`. The modifier `notSuspended(address user)` is used to check if a user has been suspended. 

## Vulnerability Detail

If a user is suspended and they have pending close requests, the user is able to call `forceClosePositon`.

## Impact
The suspended user will be able to force close their position. The impact of this issue is that it gives a user direct access to a function he/she should not have access to while their account is suspended.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the modifier `notSuspended(address user)`  to `forceClosePosition` to ensure suspended users cannot force close their own pending close requests.


```solidity

    function forceClosePosition(uint256 quoteId, PairUpnlAndPriceSig memory upnlSig)
        external
        notLiquidated(quoteId)
        notSuspended(msg.sender)
        
        whenNotPartyAActionsPaused
    {
    
        Quote storage quote = QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId];
        uint256 filledAmount = quote.quantityToClose;
        uint256 requestedClosePrice = quote.requestedClosePrice;
        PartyAFacetImpl.forceClosePosition(quoteId, upnlSig);
        emit ForceClosePosition(
            quoteId,
            quote.partyA,
            quote.partyB,
            filledAmount,
            requestedClosePrice,
            quote.quoteStatus
        );
    }
}


```
