# Liquidator can use outdated prices during liquidation

## Summary
Liquidator can use old prices when liquidating partyA, therefore manipulating liquidation outcome

## Vulnerability Detail
One of the steps of partyA liquidation process is setting symbol prices

These prices are later used to calculate quote PnL and settle balances among hedgers who had open positions with partyA.

The prices come from the signature that is verified via Muon oracle. These prices must be recent compared to liquidation time. There is a require statement to verify the signature timestamp:
```solidity
require(
    priceSig.timestamp <=
        maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
    "LiquidationFacet: Expired signature"
);
```
The problem here is that the price signature can be from way back in time and it will still pass this check. Therefore liquidator can use old prices when liquidating a user. This will lead to completely incorrect values when settling open positions.

## Impact
According to the docs liquidator is not a trusted entity. Liquidator can cause a loss of funds for some hedgers or a gain for others by picking the most convenient prices from the past.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Validate that price signature is within a range from both sides of liquidation timestamp
```solidity
        require(
            priceSig.timestamp <=
                maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
            "LiquidationFacet: Expired signature"
        );
        require(
            priceSig.timestamp >= maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA] - maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
            "LiquidationFacet: Old signature"
        );
```
