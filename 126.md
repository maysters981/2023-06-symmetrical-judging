# Liquidators are not able to  liquidate the position at the right time

## Summary
In [this part](https://docs.symm.io/protocol-overview/capital-efficiency#open-interest-oi-to-total-value-locked-tvl-ratios) from Docs
```diff
SYMM IO has an available OI to TVL ratio of 24.76
```
But the contract doesn't check that.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
PartyA could [sendQuote()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L21-L120) to any market with big leverage (e.g. x100)
this is not healthy for the protocol, especially with the volatile markets. where the price could move very quickly. Leaving the liquidators on an impossible mission to liquidate the position with `NORMAL` or `LATE` liquidation type. so in this scenario, you are gratin the liquidation type is always `OVERDUE`.
Leaving the other side with no profit and of course no `CVA` (Credit Valuation Adjustment).

## Impact
- Users are able to set the leverage to any big value
 - Liquidators are not able to liquidate the position at the right time
