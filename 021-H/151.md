# Accumulating excessive liquidation fees through repeated liquidation cycle

## Summary
When a liquidation occurs for PartyA, the liquidator can exploit a vulnerability in the process and accumulate multiple liquidation fees. After completing the liquidation process, the liquidator can immediately initiate it again using the same price signature, taking advantage of the Muon signature's valid timestamp and PartyA's reset liquidation status. This allows the liquidator to mark PartyA as liquidatable even with a minimal unrealized PNL.
## Vulnerability Detail
When a liquidation occurs for PartyA, liquidators initiate the process by invoking specific functions. Upon completion, through the final function, 'liquidatePositionsPartyA', PartyA's liquidation status is reset to false. This is to enable PartyA to continue trading in the future.

However, a problem arises here. After a liquidator completes the liquidation process, they can immediately invoke the 'liquidatePartyA' function again with the same price signature. As the timestamp for the Muon signature remains valid and the newly liquidated user's locked balances have been reset to zero, even a -1 unrealized PNL (uPNL) results in the account being deemed liquidatable and being marked as 'maLayout.liquidationStatus[partyA] = true;'.

Following this, the liquidator can again invoke the 'setSymbolsPrice' function with the same signature. Since there are no pending positions, the 'liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA' step can be skipped. Lastly, the liquidator can call the 'liquidatePositionsPartyA' function with an empty 'quoteIds' array, given the newly liquidated account has no open positions.

The issue is that the liquidation fee is transferred to the liquidator at the end of the call. Therefore, the liquidator can receive the liquidation fee twice. Worse still, the liquidator can potentially repeat this action many times, possibly up to 100 times swiftly, before the signature's timestamp expires, thereby accumulating large amounts of liquidation fees.


Scenario: 
Let's consider a scenario where Alice's account is eligible for liquidation. Let's say her locked balance for lf is $100, and here the unrealized PNL is -50$. As we assumed that Alice is in liquidation threshold, let's assume that Alice's available balance is -50$ too which is lesser than 0, she is liquidatable.

A liquidator initiates the four-step liquidation process and calculates the liquidation fee they will receive as follows: $100 (locked balance) - $50 (negative uPNL) = $50. This is demonstrated in the following code snippet:

```solidity
else if (uint256(-availableBalance) < accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].lf) {
                uint256 remainingLf = accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].lf -
                    uint256(-availableBalance);
                accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationType = LiquidationType.NORMAL;
                accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationFee = remainingLf; 
```

Assuming Alice has no pending positions, the liquidator bypasses that step. Lastly, the liquidator completes Alice's position liquidation and receives the total liquidation fee of $50. This fee comprises two equal parts of $25, corresponding to each function call. Finally, Alice's liquidation status is reset to false, and her locked balances are reduced to zero due to the liquidation outcome.

However, using the same parameters, the liquidator can repeat this cycle. Firstly, the liquidator calls 'liquidatePartyA', which sets the liquidation status to true again. Given the Muon signature remains valid and Alice now has zero locked balances, the available balance is calculated as uPNL, which was -$50. Therefore, Alice is deemed liquidatable again!

Next, the liquidator calls 'setSymbolsPrice' with the same price signature used previously, and the liquidation fee is again calculated as $50.

Now, the liquidator can call 'liquidatePositionsPartyA' with an empty 'quoteIds' input, skipping the quote accounting part. Consequently, the liquidator receives the same liquidation fee of $50 again. This cycle can be repeated by the liquidator as often as possible until the Muon signature timestamp becomes outdated.

After liq, `freeBalance` is 0. As long as upnl is something "-" then the account is liquidatable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Increment nonce somewhere in the liquidation process. Not sure where is the best but probably inside the `liquidatePartyA` function
