# Reentrancy Vulnerability in `sendQuote` function of PartyAFacet.sol

## Summary

The `sendQuote` function of the `PartyAFacet` contract is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks. This is due to the external call to `PartyAFacetImpl.sendQuote` which occurs before updating the state variable `quote`.

## Vulnerability Detail
 
Reentrancy occurs when a contract makes an external call to another untrusted contract before it resolves its state. If the called contract is malicious and implements a fallback function to call back into the calling contract, it can change the state in the middle of execution. 

In this case, the function `sendQuote` in `PartyAFacet` makes an external call to `PartyAFacetImpl.sendQuote` before the state variable `quote` is updated. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the called contract (`PartyAFacetImpl`) calls back into the `sendQuote` function.

## Impact

This vulnerability can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds if the contract `PartyAFacetImpl` is malicious or has been compromised.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
uint256 quoteId = PartyAFacetImpl.sendQuote(
    partyBsWhiteList,
    symbolId,
    positionType,
    orderType,
    price,
    quantity,
    cva,
    mm,
    lf,
    maxInterestRate,
    deadline,
    upnlSig
);
Quote storage quote = QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId];
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

As a preventive measure, consider the Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern to ensure the state is updated before making external calls.

## Proof Of Concept

1. Deploy the `PartyAFacet` and `PartyAFacetImpl` contracts.
2. Call `sendQuote` function with appropriate parameters from a contract which has a fallback function to call back into `sendQuote`.
3. The contract's state is changed during the execution of the `sendQuote` function.
