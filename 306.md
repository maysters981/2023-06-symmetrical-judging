# The functions `forceCancelQuote`, `forceCancelCloseRequest`, `forceClosePosition` has the missing modifier `onlyPartyAOfQuote` which makes it callable by anyone.

## Summary
The three functions `forceCancelQuote`, `forceCancelCloseRequest`, `forceClosePosition` from `PartyAFacet.sol` has the missing modifier `onlyPartyAOfQuote` which makes it callable by anyone. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The modifier `onlyPartyAOfQuote` is meant to be used on functions : `forceCancelQuote`, `forceCancelCloseRequest` & `forceClosePosition` and failing to do so can allow any user to make actions on PartyA's behalf.

## Impact
Since the modifier is missing, anyone can call the functions forceCancelQuote, forceCancelCloseRequest & forceClosePosition and make actions for PartyA on user's behalf.

## Recommendation

Add the modifier `onlyPartyAOfQuote` to all three functions.
