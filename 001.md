# Pragma isn't specified correctly which can lead to nonfunction/damaged contract when deployed on Arbitrum

## Summary

Pragma has been set to `>=0.8.18` allowing the contracts to be compiled with a compiler equal or greater than 0.8.18. The problem with this is that Arbitrum is [NOT compatible](https://developer.arbitrum.io/solidity-support) with 0.8.20 and newer. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Contracts compiled with those versions will result in a nonfunctional or potentially damaged version that won't behave as expected. The default behavior of compiler would be to use the newest version which would mean by default it will be compiled with the 0.8.20 version which will produce broken code.

## Impact

Damaged or nonfunctional contracts when deployed on Arbitrum.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Constrain pragma as follows:

    pragma solidity 0.8.18

 or

    pragma solidity >=0.8.0 <=0.8.19
