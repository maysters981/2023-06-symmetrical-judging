# User may open a position without required available balance

## Summary
Due to insufficient validation checks a position can be opened even though user doesn't have enough available balance to lock. This can happen for short limit orders when the open price is higher than the requested price and so the collateral needs to be bigger.

## Vulnerability Detail
When opening a position there is a validation check to make sure both parties have enough available balance to lock.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L150

This validation relies heavily on `quote.LockedValues` parameters that indicate how much a party needs to lock to open a position. These LockedValues were provided by partyA and validated against requested price:
```solidity
uint256 tradingPrice = orderType == OrderType.LIMIT ? price : upnlSig.price;
uint256 notionalValue = (quantity * tradingPrice) / 1e18;
require(
    lockedValues.total() <= notionalValue,
    "PartyAFacet: Leverage can't be lower than one"
);
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L48-L53

However, the validation logic does not consider the fact that these values can change if the open price is better than the requested price. The validation is performed on line 150, but the locked values change on line 163 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L162-L164

In case the position is SHORT, it can be opened with a price higher than requested. Collateral required for such position need to be higher as well. Since validation is performed before the change, it is possible to open a position with available balance less than collateral required, both for partyA and partyB.

**Proof of concept**

Let's modify one of the tests.

Here we create a single order for a short position at price 1e18 and then open it at 15e17. Position opens successfully and resulting account balance reads the following:
```json
{
  allocatedBalances: BigNumber { value: "495500000000000000000" },
  lockedCva: BigNumber { value: "150000000000000000000" },
  lockedMm: BigNumber { value: "505500000000000000000" },
  lockedLf: BigNumber { value: "19500000000000000000" },
  totalLocked: BigNumber { value: "675000000000000000000" },
}
```

We managed to open a position with totalLocked > allocatedBalances for partyA.

## Impact
User can open positions with less collateral than required by the protocol rules

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Solvency check has to be performed on up-to-date locked values
