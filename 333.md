# An attacker can create a position with just UPNL which should not be allowed in `sendQuote`

## Summary
An attacker can create a position with just UPNL which should not be allowed
## Vulnerability Detail
The invariant breaks that a position needs to have collateral because if the Upnl  is positive then PartyA is allowed to make that position without collateral 
and if the pnl suddenly drops after then they do not have that collateral 
steps:
1. Alice has position with PartyB(bob) and he has pnl of 1000 units of tokens 
2. Alice creates position with 1000 units of pnl 
3. Alice losses his first position but he still have 2 position with no collateral backed 
## Impact
can cause uncollateralized positions and brakes the main invariant that we need to deposit collateral/allocate 
## Code Snippet
```solidity 
// @audit as you can see balance is never checked that we have collateral but have pnl 
 if (upnl >= 0) { 
            available =
                int256(accountLayout.allocatedBalances[partyA]) +
                upnl -
                int256(
                    (accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].total() +
                        accountLayout.pendingLockedBalances[partyA].total())
                );
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
check the balance of PartyA and don't just rely on pnl for opening positions because an attacker can take advantage of this
Don't use Upnl in determining if the PartyA has enough Available.Have a second function that adds the pnl to the allocatedBalances or that user has positions
