# Unchecked Underflow in Liquidation Function

## Summary

The smart contracts provided calculate liquidations and maintain account balances for multiple parties. The vulnerable functions are found in the `LibAccount.sol` library, specifically the `partyAAvailableBalanceForLiquidation()` and `partyBAvailableBalanceForLiquidation()` functions. They both contain potential underflows when subtracting the `cva` and `lf` values from `partyBAllocatedBalances` or `allocatedBalances`.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the `cva` and `lf` values are larger than the `partyBAllocatedBalances` or `allocatedBalances`, the subtraction will cause an underflow, which can lead to inaccurate calculation of liquidations and hence disrupt the logic of the system. 

## Impact

An underflow can result in extremely high balances being incorrectly calculated. These inflated balances could be used to drain other assets or manipulate the state of the contract in ways that are advantageous to an attacker.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
int256 a = int256(accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[partyB][partyA]) -
    int256(accountLayout.partyBLockedBalances[partyB][partyA].cva +
        accountLayout.partyBLockedBalances[partyB][partyA].lf);
return a + upnl;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add a condition to check if `cva` and `lf` values are greater than the `partyBAllocatedBalances` or `allocatedBalances` before subtraction. If they are, the function should revert or handle this case differently to avoid the underflow.

## Proof of Concept

In order to reproduce this vulnerability, the following steps can be taken:

1. Deploy the contracts.
2. Add enough balance to a user such that `cva` and `lf` values are less than the balance.
3. Invoke a function that results in the increase of `cva` and `lf` values more than the available balance.
4. Call `partyAAvailableBalanceForLiquidation()` or `partyBAvailableBalanceForLiquidation()` functions.
5. The function would return an incorrect large positive balance due to underflow.
