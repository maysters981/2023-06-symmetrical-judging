# No Input Validation on 'quoteId' in `LibQuote.sol` and `LibLockedValues.sol`

## Summary

The `LibQuote.sol` and `LibLockedValues.sol` contracts are missing proper input validation, especially for `quoteId`. These contracts implement a range of actions on 'quote' objects identified by `quoteId`. If this `quoteId` is manipulated, it could lead to various undesirable consequences. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The contract is designed to take `quoteId` as an argument in various functions but does not implement proper validation checks on this value. As such, an attacker could potentially input a manipulated or invalid `quoteId`, resulting in unintended behavior. For example, if a non-existent `quoteId` is used, it could result in operations attempting to be performed on an undefined quote object.

## Impact

The absence of input validation and sanitization could potentially result in various errors, from operations attempting to execute on undefined quote objects to more complex unintended behavior. An attacker could exploit these weaknesses to cause the contract to behave in unexpected ways, potentially leading to financial loss or a disruption in service.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function removeFromOpenPositions(uint256 quoteId) internal {
        QuoteStorage.Layout storage quoteLayout = QuoteStorage.layout();
        Quote storage quote = quoteLayout.quotes[quoteId];
        ...
}

function expireQuote(uint256 quoteId) internal returns (QuoteStatus result) {
        QuoteStorage.Layout storage quoteLayout = QuoteStorage.layout();
        Quote storage quote = quoteLayout.quotes[quoteId];
        ...
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended that proper input validation be implemented for all functions that take a `quoteId` as an argument. This could involve checking that the `quoteId` is within the valid range of existing quotes before attempting to execute operations on it. Moreover, robust error handling mechanisms should be implemented to deal with potential invalid inputs.

## Proof Of Concept (Steps in order to reproduce the vulnerability)

1. Deploy the smart contracts `LibQuote.sol` and `LibLockedValues.sol` on a mainnet fork.
2. Call the `removeFromOpenPositions` or `expireQuote` functions with an invalid `quoteId` that does not correspond to an existing quote.
3. Observe that the function call does not fail, but executes with the invalid `quoteId`, leading to unexpected behavior.
