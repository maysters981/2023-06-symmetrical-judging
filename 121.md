# openPosition() need notSuspended() modifier

## Summary
To prevent suspicious users from taking funds, we can suspend `suspendedAddresses[user]=true` on the user
in `withdraw()`, `withdrawTo()`, `sendQuote()` all have this modifier restricted to take out
But `openPosition()` for partyB has no restriction
so that the user can use this path: `allocateForPartyB()` -> `openPosition()` to open an unreasonable position to maliciously lose funds to other accounts of their own

## Vulnerability Detail
When the user is Suspended, his funds can still be transferred indirectly through the following path
`allocateForPartyB()` -> `openPosition()` 

`allocateForPartyB` without notSuspended() 
```solidity
    function allocateForPartyB(
        uint256 amount,
        address partyA
    ) public whenNotPartyBActionsPaused notLiquidatedPartyB(msg.sender, partyA) onlyPartyB {
        AccountFacetImpl.allocateForPartyB(amount, partyA, true);
        emit AllocateForPartyB(msg.sender, partyA, amount);
    }
```
 `lockQuote()` , `openPosition()`  without notSuspended() 

```solidity
    function lockQuote(
        uint256 quoteId,
        SingleUpnlSig memory upnlSig
    ) external whenNotPartyBActionsPaused onlyPartyB notLiquidated(quoteId) {
        PartyBFacetImpl.lockQuote(quoteId, upnlSig, true);
        Quote storage quote = QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId];
        emit LockQuote(quote.partyB, quoteId, quote.quoteStatus);
    }

    function openPosition(
        uint256 quoteId,
        uint256 filledAmount,
        uint256 openedPrice,
        PairUpnlAndPriceSig memory upnlSig
    ) external whenNotPartyBActionsPaused onlyPartyBOfQuote(quoteId) notLiquidated(quoteId) {
```

By the unreasonable `requestedOpenPrice` and `openedPrice`  to open an unreasonable position to maliciously lose funds to other accounts of their own

Similar to `sendQuote()` we need to also restrict `openPosition() ` user not to be Suspended

## Impact
Suspended user , maliciously lose funds to other accounts of their own 
Thus withdrawing the funds and skipping the restrictions
