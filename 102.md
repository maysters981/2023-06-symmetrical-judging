# When Party A force closes a position they don't get the best price

## Summary
When Party A force closes a position it doesn't use the current price to close the position but the price party A initially requested.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a position is force closed, the contract checks whether the current price is in range of the requested price:

```sol
        if (quote.positionType == PositionType.LONG) {
            require(
                upnlSig.price >=
                    quote.requestedClosePrice +
                        (quote.requestedClosePrice * maLayout.forceCloseGapRatio) /
                        1e18,
                "PartyAFacet: Requested close price not reached"
            );
        } else {
            require(
                upnlSig.price <=
                    quote.requestedClosePrice -
                        (quote.requestedClosePrice * maLayout.forceCloseGapRatio) /
                        1e18,
                "PartyAFacet: Requested close price not reached"
            );
        }
```

But, when closing the quote, it uses the user's initially requested price: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L296-L296

That's not necessarily the optimal price for party A. If they LONGed, for example, and the price is now higher than the initially requested amount they lose some of their profit.
If the price is lower than the requested price, Party B has a loss of funds since they are forced to close a position at a different price than the current trading price.

When Party B emergency closes a position, it uses the current price no matter what the user's requested price was:
```sol
    function emergencyClosePosition(uint256 quoteId, PairUpnlAndPriceSig memory upnlSig) internal {
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        Quote storage quote = QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId];
        require(quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.OPENED, "PartyBFacet: Invalid state");
        LibMuon.verifyPairUpnlAndPrice(upnlSig, quote.partyB, quote.partyA, quote.symbolId);
        uint256 filledAmount = LibQuote.quoteOpenAmount(quote);
        quote.quantityToClose = filledAmount;
        quote.requestedClosePrice = upnlSig.price;
        LibSolvency.isSolventAfterClosePosition(quoteId, filledAmount, upnlSig.price, upnlSig);
        accountLayout.partyBNonces[quote.partyB][quote.partyA] += 1;
        accountLayout.partyANonces[quote.partyA] += 1;
        LibQuote.closeQuote(quote, filledAmount, upnlSig.price);
    }
```

## Impact
Potentially loss of profit for party A when they force close a position.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Force-closed positions should use the oracle's price instead of party A's requested price.
