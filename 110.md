# PartyBFacetImpl.openPosition can open position that is not solvent

## Summary
PartyBFacetImpl.openPosition can open position that is not solvent. This is because it checks solvency based on original locked values, but they can be adjusted if partyB price is not same as quote price.
## Vulnerability Detail
When qoute is open, then user provides price, that he would like to get. Also his provided `lockedValues` [are stored to quote](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L47).  Then his pending locking balance [is increased with locked values](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L85).
However partyB price [can be not same](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L136-L146) as provided by partyA. Because of that, locked values that back this position [can be scaled](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L162-L164).

When position is going to be open, then check is done, that it will [not make any party insolvent](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L150). This check is done before locked values rescaling.

```solidity
                Quote storage quote = QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId];
        int256 partyBAvailableBalance = LibAccount.partyBAvailableBalance(
            upnlSig.upnlPartyB,
            quote.partyB,
            quote.partyA
        );
        int256 partyAAvailableBalance = LibAccount.partyAAvailableBalance(
            upnlSig.upnlPartyA,
            quote.partyA
        );


        uint256 lockedAmount;
        uint256 lockedMM;
        if (quote.orderType == OrderType.LIMIT) {
            lockedAmount =
                (filledAmount * (quote.lockedValues.cva + quote.lockedValues.lf)) /
                quote.quantity;
            lockedMM = (filledAmount * quote.lockedValues.mm) / quote.quantity;
        } else {
            lockedAmount = quote.lockedValues.cva + quote.lockedValues.lf;
            lockedMM = quote.lockedValues.mm;
        }


        partyAAvailableBalance -= int256(lockedAmount);
        partyBAvailableBalance -= int256(lockedAmount);
```
As you can see `quote.lockedValues` are used to determine solvency. 
But this `quote.lockedValues` are original one(set when quote is created) and it can be changed later(if price of partyB is not same as quote price). They can be increased for example. In this case solvency check will show that partyA is solvent and open position. After that partyA already can be liquidatable.

This is because solvency check should be done after rescaling of quote's locked values.
