# LiquidationFacetImpl.liquidatePositionsPartyB doesn't check provided signature timestamp correctly

## Summary
LiquidationFacetImpl.liquidatePositionsPartyB doesn't check provided signature timestamp correctly
## Vulnerability Detail
When partyB is liquidated, then `partyBLiquidationTimestamp` [is set to it](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L273).
Later, `liquidatePositionsPartyB` function can be called to close positions for partyB. Liquidator provides `QuotePriceSig` to this call.

There are 2 checks of `priceSig` that are going to validate if it's provided for correct timestamp.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L318-L322
```solidity
        require(
            priceSig.timestamp <=
                maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
            "LiquidationFacet: Expired signature"
        );
```
This is first one and it checks that `priceSig` is not more in future then liquidation time + maLayout.liquidationTimeout.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L327-L330
```solidity
        require(
            block.timestamp <= priceSig.timestamp + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
            "LiquidationFacet: Expired price sig"
        );
```
This is another one, which checks that current time is not bigger than `priceSig` + maLayout.liquidationTimeout.

In order to provide valid `priceSig` it should:
1.`priceSig.timestamp <=  maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout`
2.`block.timestamp - maLayout.liquidationTimeout > priceSig.timestamp`
then we have
`block.timestamp - maLayout.liquidationTimeout > priceSig.timestamp <=  maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout`

This condition is actually incorrect, because it depends on block.timestamp, which means that if liquidator will not call this function in this time period, then he will not be able to call it later.

Correct condition should be:
`maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] >= priceSig.timestamp <=  maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout`

This means that liquidator should provide signature that was created between maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] and maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout period.
## Impact
Liquidator will not be able to call function.

## Recommendation
Use this condition to allow signature:
`maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] >= priceSig.timestamp <=  maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout`
