# Wrong pending locked balance subtraction when partyB opens a partially filled position

## Summary
While partyB opens a partially filled position, their pending locked balance will be subtracted by an amount less than expected.
## Vulnerability Detail
When partyB locks a quote, the quote amount will go into their pending locked balance.

When **partyB opens a full position**, that amount will be transferred from their pending locked balance to their locked balance. In other words, **the amount deducted from pending locked balance is equal to the amount added to the locked balance**.

However, when **the position is opened partially**, **the amount deducted from their pending locked balance is different than the amount added to their locked balance**. In this case, **the amount removed from pending locked balance should be the quote amount**, while **the amount added to locked balance should be the filled amount**.

The problem is that, in the code, **the amount removed from pending locked balance is the filled amount, not the quote amount**

## Impact
This will make partyB's locked pending balance higher than expected, essentially leading to loss of funds (for locked pending balance is taken in account when determining party B's available balance)
