# Wrong accounting leads to excess balance for partyB users depositing with the ```depositAndAllocateForPartyB()```

## Summary
Once a user issues a quote, any PartyB can secure it by providing sufficient funds, based on their estimated profit and loss from opening the position. This process can be started with separate deposit and allocate functions. However it can be done with a single function 
```solidity
function depositAndAllocateForPartyB(
        uint256 amount,
        address partyA
    ) external whenNotPartyBActionsPaused onlyPartyB {
        AccountFacetImpl.depositForPartyB(amount);
        AccountFacetImpl.allocateForPartyB(amount, partyA, true);
        emit DepositForPartyB(msg.sender, amount);
        emit AllocateForPartyB(msg.sender, partyA, amount);
    }
``` 
## Vulnerability Detail
This function makes the deposit and allocation via a single call, but deposits and allocates different amounts. 
```solidity
function depositForPartyB(uint256 amount) internal {
        IERC20(GlobalAppStorage.layout().collateral).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            address(this),
            amount
        );
        uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
        (10 ** IERC20Metadata(GlobalAppStorage.layout().collateral).decimals());
        AccountStorage.layout().balances[msg.sender] += amountWith18Decimals;
    }
```
Here we see that the balance added is not the amount of the token sent directly, but an aggregated amount after division with the ```token decimals``` and the standard ```1e18```. However in the internal allocation function, the amount passed in is allocated directly as seen below:
```solidity
    function allocateForPartyB(uint256 amount, address partyA, bool increaseNonce) internal {
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();

        require(accountLayout.balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "PartyBFacet: Insufficient balance");
        require(
            !MAStorage.layout().partyBLiquidationStatus[msg.sender][partyA],
            "PartyBFacet: PartyB isn't solvent"
        );
        if (increaseNonce) {
            accountLayout.partyBNonces[msg.sender][partyA] += 1;
        }
        accountLayout.balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[msg.sender][partyA] += amount;
    }
```
But the two functions were called with the same ```amount``` hence it does not change.  
## Impact
Imagine Bob has placed a quote and Alice wants to receive and execute the quote. 
- Bob placed a quote requiring 10,000 USDC
- Alice wants the deposit the 10,000 USDC to process it. 
- She calls the ```depositAndAllocateForPartyB``` function after approving the contract address
- It transfers 10,000 usdc from her account to the contract
- It increases her balance by 1,000,000 because of the math used. NB: USDC has 6 decimals
 ```solidity
 uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
        (10 ** IERC20Metadata(GlobalAppStorage.layout().collateral).decimals());
        AccountStorage.layout().balances[msg.sender] += amountWith18Decimals;
```
- using the same amount passed in, the function calls allocate with the amount ```10,000``` which does not complete the transaction except they had extra allocations in excess. 
- Hence rendering the function invalid
