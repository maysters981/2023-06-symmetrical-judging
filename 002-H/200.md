# In specific case, PartyB that should not be liquidated is liquidated due to wrong allocation in AccountFacet.depositAndAllocateForPartyB

## Summary

The parameter `amount` of `AccountFacet.depositAndAllocateForPartyB` is based on the decimals of the collateral. And The parameter `amount` of `AccountFacetImpl.allocateForPartyB` is based on e18. So when the collateral is USDC, the amount is a number based on e6. **In this way, the amount actually allocated is much smaller than the expected amount**. Under normal circumstances, this is not a problem, it is just a waste of gas for PartyB. **But in certain scenario, this will cause PartyB to be liquidated even though he should not have been liquidated**.

## Vulnerability Detail

`depositAndAllocateForPartyB` internally calls `AccountFacetImpl.depositForPartyB` and `AccountFacetImpl.allocateForPartyB`. `depositForPartyB` internally converts the `amount` into an e18 number.

```solidity
File: symmio-core\contracts\facets\Account\AccountFacetImpl.sol
114:         uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
115:         (10 ** IERC20Metadata(GlobalAppStorage.layout().collateral).decimals());
116:         AccountStorage.layout().balances[msg.sender] += amountWith18Decimals;
```

`allocateForPartyB` directly adds the amount(based on e18) to `accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances`.

```solidity
File: symmio-core\contracts\facets\Account\AccountFacetImpl.sol
130:         accountLayout.balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
131:         accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[msg.sender][partyA] += amount;
```

Because `depositAndAllocateForPartyB` merges the things that originally required two tx to do, this is convenient for PartyB, and can also allocate collateral to `partyBAllocatedBalances` more quickly.

Assume the following scenario: the collateral is USDC, and **PartyB_1 is on the verge of liquidation**. PartyB_1 deposits 10000e6 USDC viaÂ  `depositAndAllocateForPartyB` to **support the price fluctuation of 20%**. However, `partyBAllocatedBalances[PartyB_1][X]` only increased by 10000e6, and the actual number to be added is 10000e18. When `depositAndAllocateForPartyB` is completed, the price of symbol continues to advance in the direction of loss. Obviously, PartyB_1 was liquidated. If 10000e18 is added, then he cannot be liquidated.

## Impact

In special scenario, this will cause PartyB to be liquidated even though he should not have been liquidated. PartyB suffers funds loss.
