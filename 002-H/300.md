# Depositing and allocating funds for Party B potentially allocates less than anticipated

## Summary

The function `depositAndAllocateForPartyB` in the `AccountFacet` contract combines depositing and allocating funds for Party B into a single operation. However, a decimal precision mismatch occurs due to the lack of normalizing the `amount` parameter to 18 decimals before passing it to the `allocateForPartyB` function. This discrepancy leads to inaccurate allocations, most notably when using USDC as collateral, which uses 6 decimals as its standard.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol supports `USDT` (18 decimals) and `USDC` (6 decimals). Internally, every operation except token deposits operates with 18 decimals. When depositing tokens, the amount is normalized to 18 decimals and accounted for in `AccountStorage.layout().balances` in both the [`deposit`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L22-L23) and [`depositForPartyB`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L114-L115) functions.

Allocating previously deposited funds uses the internal 18 decimal precision.

SYMM provides a utility function `depositAndAllocateForPartyB` in the `AccountFacet` contract to deposit and allocate funds for Party B within a single function call. Party B is expected to provide the `amount` of collateral tokens to be deposited and allocated. The `amount` parameter is in the same decimal precision as the collateral token, which is either 18 decimals for USDT or 6 decimals for USDC.

However, after depositing the collateral, the call to `allocateForPartyB` directly passes the `amount` parameter without normalizing it to 18 decimals. In the case of USDC, this results in allocation significantly less than anticipated as the `allocateForPartyB` function expects the `amount` parameter to be in 18 decimal precision.

## Impact

Significantly fewer funds are allocated than anticipated by Party B for Party A. This could cause reverts when Party B attempts to lock/open/fill Party A's quotes and has insufficient allocated funds. Moreover, if Party B is on the verge of liquidation and seeks to quickly allocate additional funds to prevent such liquidation, allocating fewer tokens than anticipated could result in Party B being liquidated in a timely situation.

78:     AccountFacetImpl.depositForPartyB(amount);
79:     AccountFacetImpl.allocateForPartyB(amount, partyA, true); // @audit-issue `amount` is in same decimal precision as collateral token. Allocating funds expects 18 decimal precision.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider normalizing `amount` to 18 decimals before passing the value to the `allocateForPartyB` function. Similar to Party A's [`depositAndAllocate`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol#L50-L52) function.
