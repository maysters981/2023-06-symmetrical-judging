# Liquidator not incentivized to liquidate `LATE` or `OVERDUE` account as there is no rewards

## Summary

Liquidating certain accounts does not provide a liquidation fee to the liquidators. Liquidators will not be incentivized to liquidate such accounts, which may lead to liquidation being delayed or not performed, exposing PartyA to unnecessary risks and potentially resulting in greater asset losses than anticipated.

70:                     uint256(-availableBalance);
71:                 accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationType = LiquidationType.NORMAL;
72:                 accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationFee = remainingLf;
73:             } else if (
74:                 uint256(-availableBalance) <=
75:                 accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].lf + accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].cva
76:             ) {
77:                 uint256 deficit = uint256(-availableBalance) -
78:                     accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].lf;
79:                 accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationType = LiquidationType.LATE;
80:                 accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].deficit = deficit;
81:             } else {
82:                 uint256 deficit = uint256(-availableBalance) -
83:                     accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].lf -
84:                     accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].cva;
85:                 accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationType = LiquidationType.OVERDUE;
86:                 accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].deficit = deficit;
87:             }
88:             AccountStorage.layout().liquidators[partyA].push(msg.sender);
```

If the account to be liquidated is `LiquidationType.LATE` (Branch Line 73) or `LiquidationType.OVERDUE` (Branch Line 81), the liquidation fee will be set to zero as the liquidation fee has already been used to cover the loss.

The liquidators will not receive any liquidation fee for liquidating such positions. As a result, they will not be incentivize to liquidate such positions.

## Impact

Liquidators will not be incentivized to liquidate those accounts that do not provide them with a liquidation fee. As a result, the liquidation of those accounts might be delayed or not performed at all. When liquidation is not performed in a timely manner, PartyA ended up taking on additional unnecessary risks that could be avoided in the first place if a different liquidation incentive mechanism is adopted, potentially leading to PartyA losing more assets than expected.

Although PartyAs are incentivized to perform liquidation themselves since it is the PartyAs that take on the most risks from the late liquidation, the roles of PartyA and liquidator are clearly segregated in the protocol design. Only addresses granted the role of liquidators can perform liquidation as the liquidation functions are guarded by `onlyRole(LibAccessibility.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE)`. Unless the contracts are implemented in a manner that the liquidation functions are made permissionless, PartyAs are likely not able to perform the liquidation themselves when the need arises.

Moreover, the PartyAs are not expected to be both a user and liquidator simultaneously. They might not have the skillset or resources to maintain an infrastructure for monitoring their accounts/positions for potential late liquidation. Most PartyAs are likely normal retail users who only intend to trade on the platform but do not perform liquidation.

## Recommendation

Considering updating the liquidation incentive mechanism that will always provide some incentive for the liquidators to take the initiative to liquidate insolvent accounts. This will help to build a more robust and efficient liquidation mechanism for the protocols. One possible approach is to always give a percentage of the CVA of the liquidated account as a liquidation fee to the liquidators.
