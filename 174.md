# Lack of scaling the decimals precision in the AccountFacet#`depositAndAllocateForPartyB()`, which lead to a misaccounting

## Summary
Within the AccountFacet#`depositAndAllocateForPartyB()`, the `amount` scaled to `1e18` decimals precision is supposed to be assigned into the AccountFacetImpl#`allocateForPartyB()`.

However, within the AccountFacet#`depositAndAllocateForPartyB()`, the `amount`, which is `1e6` decimals (Not scaled), would be assigned into the AccountFacetImpl#`allocateForPartyB()` as it is.

This  lead to a misaccounting that the `amount` subtracted from the `balances` storage in the AccountFacetImpl#`allocateForPartyB()` would be `1e12` times smaller than the actual amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

Within the AccountFacet#`depositAndAllocateForPartyB()`, the `amount` would be assigned as a parameter.
Then, the AccountFacetImpl#`allocateForPartyB()` would be called and the `amount` would be assigned into there like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol#L79
```solidity
    function depositAndAllocateForPartyB(
        uint256 amount,  /// @audit
        address partyA 
    ) external whenNotPartyBActionsPaused onlyPartyB {
        AccountFacetImpl.depositForPartyB(amount);  
        AccountFacetImpl.allocateForPartyB(amount, partyA, true);  /// @audit - This "amount" must be 1e18 decimals precision
        ...
    }
```

Within the AccountFacetImpl#`allocateForPartyB()`, the `amount` would be subtract from the `balances` storage like this:
(NOTEï¼šThe `amount` assigned into the `balances` storage below is supposed to be `1e18` decimals precision)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L130
```solidity
    function allocateForPartyB(uint256 amount, address partyA, bool increaseNonce) internal { /// @audit
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();

        require(accountLayout.balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "PartyBFacet: Insufficient balance");
        require(
            !MAStorage.layout().partyBLiquidationStatus[msg.sender][partyA],
            "PartyBFacet: PartyB isn't solvent"
        );
        if (increaseNonce) {
            accountLayout.partyBNonces[msg.sender][partyA] += 1;
        }
        accountLayout.balances[msg.sender] -= amount;   /// @audit
        accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[msg.sender][partyA] += amount;
    }
```

Within the AccountFacet#`depositAndAllocateForPartyB()` above, the `amount` assigned as a parameter would be `1e6` decimals precision. 

And then, within the AccountFacet#`depositAndAllocateForPartyB()` above, the AccountFacetImpl#`depositForPartyB()` and the AccountFacetImpl#`allocateForPartyB()` would be called. The `amount` assigned into each function is supposed to be like this: 
- The `amount` that is assigned into the AccountFacetImpl#`depositForPartyB()` is supposed to be `1e6` decimals precision. 
- The `amount` that is assigned into the AccountFacetImpl#`allocateForPartyB()` is supposed to be `1e18` decimals precision. 

However, the `amount` assigned into the AccountFacetImpl#`allocateForPartyB()` would not be scaled to `1e18` decimals precision. (Instead, the `amount` that is `1e6` decimals precision would be assigned into the AccountFacetImpl#`allocateForPartyB()` as it is)

## Impact
This lead to a misaccounting that the `amount`, which subtracted from the `balances` storage in the AccountFacetImpl#`allocateForPartyB()`, would be `1e12` times smaller than the actual amount.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L130

This vulnerability would always be caused every single time when the AccountFacet#`depositAndAllocateForPartyB()` would be called. Thus, this severity is marked as "High".

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Within the AccountFacet#`depositAndAllocateForPartyB()`, consider assigning the amount scaled to `1e18` into the AccountFacetImpl#`allocateForPartyB()` like this:
```solidity
    function depositAndAllocateForPartyB(
        uint256 amount,
        address partyA 
    ) external whenNotPartyBActionsPaused onlyPartyB {
        AccountFacetImpl.depositForPartyB(amount);
+       uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
+       (10 ** IERC20Metadata(GlobalAppStorage.layout().collateral).decimals());
+       AccountFacetImpl.allocateForPartyB(amountWith18Decimals, partyA, true); 
-       AccountFacetImpl.allocateForPartyB(amount, partyA, true); 
        ...
    }
```
