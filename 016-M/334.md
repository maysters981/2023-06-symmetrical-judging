# The protocol allows opening a max possible position but prevents the user from keeping it healthy

## Summary
The protocol allows a partyA to allocate funds upto `balanceLimitPerUser` and open max position but after that it prevents that user from keeping that position healthy by allocating more collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `AccountFacetImpl.allocate` looks like this 
```solidity
    function allocate(uint256 amount) internal {
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        require(
            accountLayout.allocatedBalances[msg.sender] + amount <=
            GlobalAppStorage.layout().balanceLimitPerUser,
            "AccountFacet: Allocated balance limit reached"
        );
        require(accountLayout.balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "AccountFacet: Insufficient balance");
        accountLayout.partyANonces[msg.sender] += 1;
        accountLayout.balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        accountLayout.allocatedBalances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }
```

As can be seen above, a partyA can allocate upto `balanceLimitPerUser` and open positions with that allocated balance. However if the health factor of those postions depletes then the partyA cannot restore the heath of those positions by allocating more funds.

## Impact
Due to this a max allocated and max leveraged user becomes susceptible to liquidation forcefully.

Note that, the issue and scenario reported in #15 can also be combined with this issue to make the situation even worse for a particular partyA.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
User must be allowed to top up his allocated balance to protect his positions from getting liquidated and loosing funds. 

A margin can also be introduced, for eg, a user only allocate a maximum of 90% of `balanceLimitPerUser`.
