# A partyA liquidation may be impossible to conclude if UPNL for one quote exceeds partyB's allocated funds

## Summary
A partyA liquidation may be impossible to conclude if for one quote its unrealized profit exceeds partyB's allocated funds

## Vulnerability Detail
We can see that during a partyA liquidation, all opened quotes are closed, realizing UPNL computed here:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L152-L156

However as we can see the amount computed is unbounded, and dependent only on market conditions:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibQuote.sol#L100-L120

As such, it may be unbounded, and in the case partyA makes a very large* profit on one quote:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L170
(*larger than `accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA]`)

The whole liquidation may revert due to an underflow:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L170 

Which means that the liquidator can never get their share of liquidation fee for this liquidation, and partyA is definitely bricked.

## Impact
The liquidation of a partyA is impossible due to market conditions, and the liquidationFee is definitely bricked.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maybe replace this subtract by:
```solidity
    accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA] -= min(amount, accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA]);
```
