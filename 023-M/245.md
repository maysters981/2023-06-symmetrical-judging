# Rounding error causing assets to be stolen during withdrawal or lost during deposit

## Summary

Rounding errors could cause assets to be stolen during withdrawal or lost during deposit under certain conditions.

## Vulnerability Detail

#### Instance 1 - Token to be stolen during withdrawal

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L27

```solidity
File: AccountFacetImpl.sol
27:     function withdraw(address user, uint256 amount) internal {
28:         AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
29:         GlobalAppStorage.Layout storage appLayout = GlobalAppStorage.layout();
30:         require(
31:             block.timestamp >=
32:             accountLayout.withdrawCooldown[msg.sender] + MAStorage.layout().deallocateCooldown,
33:             "AccountFacet: Cooldown hasn't reached"
34:         );
35:         uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
36:         (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());
37:         accountLayout.balances[msg.sender] -= amountWith18Decimals;
38:         IERC20(appLayout.collateral).safeTransfer(user, amount);
39:     }
```

If the collateral changes to a token with more than 18 decimals in the future, users can drain assets from the contract.

If the collateral's decimals is larger than 18, it will be possible to specify a small `amount,` and the `amountWith18Decimals` will be rounded down to zero in Line 35-36 above. Then, in Line 37, nothing will be deducted from the account as `amountWith18Decimals` is zero.

In Line 38, the `amount`, which is non-zero, of collateral will be transferred to the users.

In summary, non-zero collateral is transferred to users, but nothing is deducted from the account balance. Repeat this process multiple times until all the collaterals in the contract are drained.

Based on the `setCollateral` function, it did not explicitly block collateral with decimals larger than 18. Thus, based on the current design and implementation, it is possible to introduce a collateral with decimals more than 18 in the future.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/control/ControlFacet.sol#L95

```solidity
File: ControlFacet.sol
095:     function setCollateral(
096:         address collateral
097:     ) external onlyRole(LibAccessibility.DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
098:         GlobalAppStorage.layout().collateral = collateral;
099:         emit SetCollateral(collateral);
100:     }
```

#### Instance 2 - Token to be lost during deposit

The similar issue will occur within the following functions, but with the opposite effect. The users deposit assets to the contract, but their account balance does not increase due to rounding errors.

- `AccountFacetImpl.deposit`
- `AccountFacetImpl.depositForPartyB`
- `AccountFacet.depositAndAllocate`

```solidity
File: AccountFacetImpl.sol
19:     function deposit(address user, uint256 amount) internal {
20:         GlobalAppStorage.Layout storage appLayout = GlobalAppStorage.layout();
21:         IERC20(appLayout.collateral).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
22:         uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
23:         (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());
24:         AccountStorage.layout().balances[user] += amountWith18Decimals;
25:     }
```

If the user deposits a small number of collateral tokens to the contract, the `amountWith18Decimals` in Line 22 might round down to zero. In this case, the collateral tokens have been transferred to the protocol, but the account balance did not increase in Line 24.

## Impact

Loss of funds if the collateral is updated to a token with decimals more than 18 in the future. Since it requires certain specific conditions for the issue to be exploitable, marking this issue as a Medium instead of a High.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing one of the following fixes to mitigate the issue

#### Solution 1

Update the affected function to revert if rounding errors occur.

```diff
function withdraw(address user, uint256 amount) internal {
	..SNIP..
    uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
    (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());
+	require(amountWith18Decimals > 0, "Rounding Error Occur")
    accountLayout.balances[msg.sender] -= amountWith18Decimals;
    IERC20(appLayout.collateral).safeTransfer(user, amount);
}
```

```diff
function deposit(address user, uint256 amount) internal {
    GlobalAppStorage.Layout storage appLayout = GlobalAppStorage.layout();
    IERC20(appLayout.collateral).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
    uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
    (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());
+	require(amountWith18Decimals > 0, "Rounding Error Occur")
    AccountStorage.layout().balances[user] += amountWith18Decimals;
}
```

#### Solution 2

If the protocol does not intend to support collateral tokens with more than 18 decimals, explicitly disallow anyone from configuring such tokens in the future to prevent malicious user from exploiting this issue.

```solidity
function setCollateral(
    address collateral
) external onlyRole(LibAccessibility.DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    GlobalAppStorage.layout().collateral = collateral;
    require(IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals() <= 18, "Token with more than 18 decimals not allowed")
    emit SetCollateral(collateral);
}
```
