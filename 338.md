# `liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA` dosnt give fee back when PartyA has positions in pending and instead liquidates them which should'nt happen

## Summary
so if PartyA has a position with 0 address or with positions that are in the pending state then they get liquidated there is no way to get  trading fee/pending funds back even though the positions are pending/ in the spec  and not accounted in liquidations 
## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/6d2b64b6732fcfbd07c8217897dd233dbb6cd1f5/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L99
Steps:
naturally through PartyA's own occurrences (like taking limit orders that haven't been filled yet for some reason like high price/low price)
shouldn't be liquidated least PartyA should get the trading fees back or pendingLockedBalances
Or if a big price movement happens This can cause unexpected loss of funds 
```solidity
            if (
                (quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.LOCKED ||
                    quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.CANCEL_PENDING) &&
                quoteLayout.partyBPendingQuotes[quote.partyB][partyA].length > 0
            ) {
                delete quoteLayout.partyBPendingQuotes[quote.partyB][partyA]; 
                AccountStorage
                .layout()
                .partyBPendingLockedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA].makeZero(); 
            }
            quote.quoteStatus = QuoteStatus.LIQUIDATED; // @audit   M-14 see here that a position that is not locked or cancel_pending gets liquidated and there is nothing PartyA can call to fix this or to cancel the position
            quote.modifyTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        }
        AccountStorage.layout().pendingLockedBalances[partyA].makeZero();
        delete quoteLayout.partyAPendingQuotes[partyA];

```
## Impact
Loss of funds for PartyA even if small for TradingFee but also makes pendingBalnace zero which is a loss that should not be accounted for.
The reasons I would justify it being an issue is because even though a user can call `requestToCancelQuote` to cancel the position there is no documentation on this type of scenario and the user will not be able to call in 2 steps in liquidation so are we relying on PartyA to front run the liquidations?
A: My basis probably    for the sake of users this can cause loss for their pending Positions(with big price movement this can be more of a risk)
## Code Snippet
```solidity
     QuoteStorage.Layout storage quoteLayout = QuoteStorage.layout();
        require(
            MAStorage.layout().liquidationStatus[partyA],
            "LiquidationFacet: PartyA is solvent"
        );
        for (uint256 index = 0; index < quoteLayout.partyAPendingQuotes[partyA].length; index++) {
            Quote storage quote = quoteLayout.quotes[
                quoteLayout.partyAPendingQuotes[partyA][index]
            ];
            if (
                (quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.LOCKED ||
                    quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.CANCEL_PENDING) &&
                quoteLayout.partyBPendingQuotes[quote.partyB][partyA].length > 0
            ) {
                delete quoteLayout.partyBPendingQuotes[quote.partyB][partyA];
                AccountStorage
                .layout()
                .partyBPendingLockedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA].makeZero();
            }
            quote.quoteStatus = QuoteStatus.LIQUIDATED;
            quote.modifyTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        }
        AccountStorage.layout().pendingLockedBalances[partyA].makeZero();
        delete quoteLayout.partyAPendingQuotes[partyA];
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add for those edge cases and give back at least the fee for the PartyA but I also think give back PendingBalance
