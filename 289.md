# Leverage can change for market orders once the position is opened

## Summary

Opening a market order with a different open price than the requested open price changes the leverage of the position.

## Vulnerability Detail

The SYMM protocol allows future trading with leverage. The leverage is initially determined by the ratio of the quote's locked values (lf, cva, and mm) to the notional value of the quote.

Opening a position with the total requested quantity adjusts the locked values of the quote if the order is a limit order. This allows for maintaining the same leverage as when the order was initially created.

However, if the order is a market order, the locked values are not adjusted, resulting in a different leverage than initially assumed.

## Impact

The assumed fixed leverage for a market order changes. Depending on the position type, the leverage can increase or decrease:

- For a **long position**, the leverage **decreases** (`openedPrice` is lower than `requestedOpenPrice`)
- For a **short position**, the leverage **increases** (`openedPrice` is higher than `requestedOpenPrice`)

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adjusting the quote's locked values (and thus also the locked balances for both parties) for market orders as well.
