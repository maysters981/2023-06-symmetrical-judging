# POSSIBLE LOSS OF OWNERSHIP

## Summary
`LibDiamond.setContractOwner` lacks access control which can lead to setting owner to malicious address resulting in loss of contract control

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
File: LibDiamond.sol
    function setContractOwner(address _newOwner) internal {
        DiamondStorage storage ds = diamondStorage();
        address previousOwner = ds.contractOwner;
        ds.contractOwner = _newOwner;
        emit OwnershipTransferred(previousOwner, _newOwner);
    }
```
According https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2535#ownership-and-authentication
setting a new owner should be strictly controlled through many steps to avoid being attacked by losing control of the contract causing protocol failure.

## Impact
Contract `LibDiamond.sol` can go out of control because malicious actors can easily set newOwner

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider redeploying ownership transfers in `LibDiamond.sol`. For example ownership/authentication could be as simple as a single account address having the authority to add/replace/remove functions. Or a decentralized autonomous organization could have the authority to only add/replace/remove certain functions.
