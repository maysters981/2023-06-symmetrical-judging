# partyA can block partyB from opening position when it's not favorable for it

## Summary
partyA can block partyB from opening position when it's not favorable for it. It can do that by changing its nonce.
## Vulnerability Detail
When partyB wants to open position, then it needs to provide `PairUpnlAndPriceSig` signature, which contains information about pnl and price.

This signature [needs to be validated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L147) in order to open position.
As you can see in order to check signature [nonce of partyA is used](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibMuon.sol#L180). That means that once nonce has changed, then signature is not valid anymore.

When user allocates funds, then [nonce is increased](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L49). The same is done [when deallocation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L65).

Another thing that is needed to note is that when user create quote, then he can provide any deadline he wishes.
This actually means that user in create quotes with not big deadline and then observe. In case if prices are ok, then he will allow partyB to open position. Otherwise he will frontrun each `openPosition` with allocating/deallocating of small amount and when deadline passed, then he can expire it or do nothing.
## Impact
User can do trades without losses.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maybe allocate and deallocate should not change nonce, as it actually doesn't have impact on pnl, because pnl changes, when you somehow change positions. I am not sure about that.
