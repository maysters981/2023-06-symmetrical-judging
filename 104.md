# lockQuote should lock exactly filledAmount that partyB is going to open for Limit orders

## Summary
lockQuote should lock exactly filledAmount that partyB is going to open for Limit orders
## Vulnerability Detail
partyA can create qoute with some quantity that it would like to be fulfilled.
Orders can be limit and market. When position is open for market order then partyB [should fill all order](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L134). But for limit order it [just should not be 0](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L129-L132).

When partyB locks qoute, then it's not available for anyone else. And the whole qoute is locked.

This is actually not good for partyA.
Let's check example.
1.partyA creates long limit order with quantity 100 at price 1500.
2.partyB immediately locks it.
3.after some time partyB open position for only 1 quantity, because it sees, that prices has changed and it's not favorable anymore or because it can't fulfill all order.
4.Now this order becomes pending with quantity 99. But some time already passed and partyB will likely not lock it, because prices have changed. But if initial partyB locked only 1 quantity, then another partyB might lock another amount and user's qoute can be fulfilled.

So there are 2 problems here.
1.Not honest partyB will execute only small part of quantity to avoid losses.
2.When partyB locks all order and fulfills not whole amount, then all quantity is locked and can't be fulfilled by another partyB. At the moment, when qoute will become pending again prices can change.
## Impact
partyB can use this to avoid losses.

## Recommendation
Maybe you can allow to lock only part that should be fulfilled.
