# partyA's market order's requestedOpenPrice(worst tolerance) is always taken for openPosition from partyB instead of the latest marketPrice from gateway

## Summary
partyA's requestedOpenPrice(worst tolerance) is always taken for openPosition from partyB instead of the latest marketPrice from gateway

## Vulnerability Detail
when partyA sendQuote for market order, it sends the marketPrice (signed from gateway) along with the worst acceptable price that he/she is willing to take. For example if the market price is $1000 and he is willing to bid no higher than $1010, then price is $1010.

```solidity
library PartyAFacetImpl {
...
    function sendQuote(
        // create quote.
        Quote memory quote = Quote({
            id: currentId,
            partyBsWhiteList: partyBsWhiteList,
            symbolId: symbolId,
            positionType: positionType,
            orderType: orderType,
            openedPrice: 0,
            requestedOpenPrice: price,
            marketPrice: upnlSig.price,
...
```

However, when PartyB takes this quote and open position for partyA, it could send an arbitrary price in the function for openPrice, as long as the openPrice is not worse than the worst tolerated price specified above by partyA,  instead of the signed gateway market price from `upnlSig` at the time of execution.

```solidity
library PartyBFacetImpl {
...
    function openPosition(
        uint256 quoteId,
        uint256 filledAmount,
        uint256 openedPrice,
        PairUpnlAndPriceSig memory upnlSig
    )
... // check openPrice is not worse than the tolerance
       if (quote.positionType == PositionType.LONG) {
            require(
                openedPrice <= quote.requestedOpenPrice,
                "PartyBFacet: Opened price isn't valid"
            )
... // use the input price as the openedPrice 
quote.openedPrice = openedPrice;
...
```

## Impact
partyA's worst accepted price can always be used to open positions. This creates unfair opportunity for partyB since market price is not utilized.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using the signed price from Gateway for checking as well as for execution if partyB is taking the order from partyA
```solidity
library PartyBFacetImpl {
...
    function openPosition(
...
   // check the signed price is not worse than the tolerance
       if (quote.positionType == PositionType.LONG) {
            require(
                upnlSig.price <= quote.requestedOpenPrice,
                "PartyBFacet: Opened price isn't valid"
            )
quote.openedPrice = upnlSig.price;
```
