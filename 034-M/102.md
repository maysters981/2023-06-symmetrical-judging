# PartyB has ability to check prices and unlock unfavourite orders

## Summary
PartyB has ability to check prices and unlock unfavourite orders
## Vulnerability Detail
When partyA creates quote, then it becomes Pending and then partyB [can lock it](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L22).
When order is locked, that means that partyB is going to execute it according to the price that was provided by user(prices can be even better).
Also when order is locked, then no one else can lock it.

But partyB can call `unlockQuote` function, which will just make order pending again.

This function actually allows partyB to block every order and execute only favourable once. If partyB see, that order is not favourable, then he can call `unlockQuote` function.
## Impact
PartyB has ability to make only winning trade.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Once, order is locked, then partyB should execute it. Because when it locked order, then partyB confirmed prices in qoute.
