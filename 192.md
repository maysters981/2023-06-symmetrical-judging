# Users can DOS liquidation process by increasing their nonce

## Summary

Users can DOS liquidation process by increasing their nonce.

## Vulnerability Detail

The liquidation process is initiated by calling `liquidatePartyA` or `liquidatePartyB` functions of the `LiquidationFacetImpl` library. They  receive `upnlSig` as a parameter and use the functions `verifyPartyAUpnl` and `verifyPartyBUpnl` from the `LibMuon` library. These functions check that the received signature matches with the hash of some of the received parameters plus some additional data. That additional data contains the nonce of the party A or party B.

An insolvent user can check the mempool and front-run the liquidation process by increasing the nonce. This can be done for example by allocating or deallocating any amount. After the nonce has been increased, the signature sent by the liquidator will not work anymore and the liquidation process will fail. The liquidator will need to request a new signature to the Muon app and repeat the process, which can be front-run again.

## Impact

A user that is going to be liquidated can DOS the liquidation process by increasing his nonce. This can be done in order to wait for the market prices to change and avoid the liquidation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A possible solution is to apply a timelock between allocation and deallocation operations.

Another approach could be that instead of sending the uPnL data, it is sent the prices of the open quotes, and the calculation of the uPnL is done on-chain. The drawback is that this would increase the gas cost of the liquidation process, and could require to adapt the code to do the process in multiple transactions, as the gas limit could be reached.
