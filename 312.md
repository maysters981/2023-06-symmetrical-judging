# Unrestricted access to forceCancelQuote(), forceCancelCloseRequest(), and forceClosePosition() Functions can cause system chaos

## Summary

The contract contains three functions responsible for forced operations, which are protected by only two modifiers: notLiquidated(quoteId) and whenNotPartyAActionsPaused. 

     modifier notLiquidated(uint256 quoteId) {
        Quote storage quote = QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId];
        require(
            !MAStorage.layout().liquidationStatus[quote.partyA],
            "Accessibility: PartyA isn't solvent"
        );
        require(
            !MAStorage.layout().partyBLiquidationStatus[quote.partyB][quote.partyA],
            "Accessibility: PartyB isn't solvent"
        );
        require(
            quote.quoteStatus != QuoteStatus.LIQUIDATED && quote.quoteStatus != QuoteStatus.CLOSED,
            "Accessibility: Invalid state"
        );
        _;
    }

    modifier whenNotPartyAActionsPaused() {
        require(!GlobalAppStorage.layout().globalPaused, "Pausable: Global paused");
        require(!GlobalAppStorage.layout().partyAActionsPaused, "Pausable: PartyA actions paused");
        _;
    }

This setup allows any malicious user to manipulate the system by closing quotes/positions or cancelling close requests.

## Vulnerability Detail

The documentation lacks information about force operations and functions. However, in the Q&A section, it is mentioned that there are off-chain mechanisms like Liquidator Bots, Force close Bots, Force cancel Bots, and Anomaly detector Bots.

So the system should have force cancel/close Bots which a responsible for calling 3 functions mentioned above.

During the audit, it was discovered that the only preventive measure in place to restrict the use of these three functions is a require statement.

However, this require statement renders these three functions ineffective because the cooldown period is unreachable, as shown in this code:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/control/ControlFacet.sol#L25-L27

On the other hand, the code includes three functions that set up cooldown periods, indicating that the developers plan to assign more realistic values to these periods.

Taking all factors into consideration, it can be concluded that these three force functions are within the scope of the audit and should have a modifier to protect them from being called by unauthorized users.

## Impact

According to the readme file, the application will be deployed in multiple chains, including Arbitrum One, Arbitrum Nova, Fantom, Optimism, BNB chain, Polygon, and Avalanche. 
Transactions on these chains are relatively inexpensive, making it possible for a malicious user to create chaos in the system by canceling quotes and closing the positions of all users. 
This issue is classified as high severity because it has the potential to disrupt the entire protocol's functionality.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add "Force close Bots" and "Force cancel Bots" modifiers to the forceCancelQuote(), forceCancelCloseRequest(), and forceClosePosition() functions to enhance their security and prevent unauthorized access.
