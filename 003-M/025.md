# PartyB's profits are reduced, due to liquidator lateness

## Summary
The current implementation of the code results in an inconsistency regarding the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) when liquidations either on purpose or mistakenly come late to a liquidation. This "mistake" can be caused due to a REORG, fast falling prices or just liquidator's incompetence.

## Vulnerability Detail
> cva: Credit Valuation Adjustment. In the V3 system, either partyA or partyB can get liquidated **and CVA is the penalty that the liquidated side should pay to the other one**

The problem arises from the fact that the party on the receiving end may not receive the full CVA or may not be penalized appropriately if a liquidator initiates the liquidation process late.

Example scenario:

When a liquidation is marked as **LATE** and the liquidator calls `liquidatePositionsPartyA()`, the following [code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L174-L185) is executed:

```jsx
      else if (
          accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationType == LiquidationType.LATE
      ) {
          accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA] +=
              quote.lockedValues.cva -
              ((quote.lockedValues.cva * accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].deficit) /                                                                    accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].cva);
        }
```

In this code snippet, `(cva * deficit) / cva` is deducted from the CVA, and the `deficit` is calculated as follows:
```jsx
uint256 deficit = uint256(-availableBalance) - accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].lf;
```
The issue arises from overdue liquidations, which result in a long-term loss of funds. This occurs due to the deduction from partyB's winnings for system losses from the won amount. The following code snippet explains the problem:

When liquidations are marked as NORMAL or LATE, partyB's winnings are neutralized (cva is lowered but only in LATE). This means that if we assume the same bet on a 50% win chance, the "game" can continue indefinitely. This is achieved through the following code:
```jsx
  if (hasMadeProfit) {
    accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA] -= amount;
  } else {
    accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA] += amount;
  }
```
However, when liquidations are marked as **OVERDUE**, the payout calculation for partyB treats it as a profit for the system over partyB's account. In this case, every loss of funds (due to partyA winning the short/long trade) is deducted in full (100%), but from every win (when partyB gets the trade correct), the deficit amount is subtracted. This causes partyB to lose in the long term for every OVERDUE trade. Losses will be paid in full (by partyB), but winnings will only be paid partially (to partyB,) resulting in a net loss for partyB.
```jsx
  if (hasMadeProfit) {
    accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA] -= amount;
  } else {
      accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA] +=
        amount -
        ((amount * accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].deficit) /
        uint256(-accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].totalUnrealizedLoss));
}
```
A comparison can be made to Roulette, where the casino wins in the long term since players lose approximately 1% of their money on every game, due to the game's design.

## Impact
PartyB profits are wrongly reduced on liquidation

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A solution should be implemented where partyB receives the promised CVA, and the profits made by the liquidators are appropriately reduced.
