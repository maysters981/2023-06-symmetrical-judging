# Liquidation of a partyB be stuck, definitely bricking allocated funds

## Summary
A partyB liquidation may end up indefinitely stuck, bricking allocated funds on partyB and partyA's side

## Vulnerability Detail
We can see that for a partyB liquidation to proceed, some conditions need to be verified on the timestamps:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L318-L330

However if the liquidator is unable to call `liquidatePositionsPartyB` shortly enough after having initiated liquidation through `liquidatePartyB`, the call to `liquidatePositionsPartyB` may revert indefinitely.

We can see that if:
`priceSig.timestamp > maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout`

the call reverts.

Also if:
`block.timestamp > priceSig.timestamp + maLayout.liquidationTimeout`

the call also reverts.

Which means that if `block.timestamp > maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] + 2*maLayout.liquidationTimeout`

The call will always revert, the liquidation process is stuck, and allocated funds for the quote are bricked.

## Impact
Allocated funds for a quote in liquidation process end up bricked

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the condition:
```solidity
require(
    block.timestamp <= priceSig.timestamp + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
    "LiquidationFacet: Expired price sig"
);
```

to:

```solidity
require(
    maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] <= priceSig.timestamp + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
    "LiquidationFacet: Expired price sig"
);
```
Since we only want to enforce that the price is fresh enough with reference to the liquidation
