# Reentrancy Vulnerability and Lack of Input Validation in `sendQuote` Function

## Summary

The `sendQuote` function in the `PartyAFacet` and `PartyAFacetImpl` contracts contains two vulnerabilities. First, the `sendQuote` function in `PartyAFacet` is vulnerable to reentrancy attacks due to an external call to `PartyAFacetImpl.sendQuote` before updating the `quote` state variable. Second, the `sendQuote` function in `PartyAFacetImpl` lacks proper input validation, potentially leading to issues with order processing.

## Vulnerability Detail

Reentrancy Vulnerability:

Reentrancy occurs when a contract makes an external call to another untrusted contract before it resolves its state. In the case of the `sendQuote` function in `PartyAFacet`, the external call to `PartyAFacetImpl.sendQuote` occurs before updating the `quote` state variable. This vulnerability allows a malicious or compromised `PartyAFacetImpl` contract to manipulate the state during execution, leading to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds.

Lack of Input Validation:

The `sendQuote` function in `PartyAFacetImpl` doesn't properly validate input data, particularly for parameters such as `symbolId`, `positionType`, and `orderType`. The lack of validation can result in logical issues within the contract, processing orders that don't exist or are incorrect.

## Impact

The reentrancy vulnerability can lead to unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds if the `PartyAFacetImpl` contract is malicious or compromised. The lack of input validation can result in logical issues with order processing, potentially affecting the correctness and integrity of the contract.

## Code Snippet

Reentrancy Vulnerability:
```solidity
uint256 quoteId = PartyAFacetImpl.sendQuote(
    partyBsWhiteList,
    symbolId,
    positionType,
    orderType,
    price,
    quantity,
    cva,
    mm,
    lf,
    maxInterestRate,
    deadline,
    upnlSig
);
Quote storage quote = QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId];
```

Lack of Input Validation:
```solidity
function sendQuote(
    address[] memory partyBsWhiteList,
    uint256 symbolId,
    PositionType positionType,
    OrderType orderType,
    uint256 price,
    uint256 quantity,
    uint256 cva,
    uint256 mm,
    uint256 lf,
    uint256 maxInterestRate,
    uint256 deadline,
    SingleUpnlAndPriceSig memory upnlSig
) internal returns (uint256 currentId) {
    // Function Body
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

1. Reentrancy Vulnerability: Implement the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to update the state before making external calls. This ensures that the state is resolved before any potential reentrancy vulnerability arises.

2. Lack of Input Validation: Thoroughly validate all function parameters, especially enumerated types like `symbolId`, `positionType`, and `orderType`. Proper validation will prevent processing orders that are invalid or don't exist, ensuring the correctness of order processing.

## Proof of Concept

To reproduce these vulnerabilities:

1. Deploy the `PartyAFacet` and `PartyAFacetImpl` contracts.
2. Exploit the reentrancy vulnerability by calling the `sendQuote` function from a contract with a fallback function that calls back into `sendQuote`.
3. Observe the unexpected behavior and potential loss of funds due to the reentrancy vulnerability.
4. Exploit the lack of input validation by calling the `sendQuote` function with invalid `symbolId`, `positionType`, or `orderType`.
5. Observe the logical issues in order processing caused by the lack of input validation.
