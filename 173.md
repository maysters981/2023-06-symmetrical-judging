# PartyA and PartyB can collude together to get funds out of a suspended account

## Summary

PartyA and PartyB can collude together to get funds out of a suspended account

A suspended account is suspended from sending a quote and withdrawal, however, PartyB can still accept the existing quotes sent by the suspended account (PartyA), so PartyA and PartyB can collude together to withdraw the funds.

In order to achieve this, PartyB opens positions for PartyA's existing quotes, then PartyA requests to close the positions in a loss, PartyB accepts the close requests and close positions, funds are paid to PartyB, PartyB can then withdraw and get the funds out of the protocol, send them to PartyA.

## Impact

Funds are withdrawn from a suspended account.
