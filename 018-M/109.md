# Incorrect Calculation of Maintenance Margin in PartyBFacetImpl.sol.openPosition Function for MARKET Orders

## Summary
A vulnerability exists in the `PartyBFacetImpl.sol.openPosition` function. When the orderType is MARKET, discrepancies can occur in the setting of the Maintenance Margin (mm). This is significant because when the loss of PartyA or PartyB becomes larger than mm, they can be put into a state where liquidation is possible.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability lies in the logic of the `openPosition` function which moves pending locked balances to locked balances. PartyB can set the `openPrice` during the `openPosition`, and can propose a price that is more advantageous to PartyA based on `quote.requestedOpenPrice`. If the orderType is LIMIT, the `lockedBalance` is adjusted according to the actual `openedPrice` compared to the `requestedOpenPrice`. However, there is no such logic for MARKET orders, leading to discrepancies that can occur from what PartyA originally intended.

```solidity
        if (quote.quantity == filledAmount) {
            accountLayout.pendingLockedBalances[quote.partyA].subQuote(quote);
            accountLayout.partyBPendingLockedBalances[quote.partyB][quote.partyA].subQuote(quote);

            if (quote.orderType == OrderType.LIMIT) { 
                quote.lockedValues.mul(openedPrice).div(quote.requestedOpenPrice); 
            }
            accountLayout.lockedBalances[quote.partyA].addQuote(quote);
            accountLayout.partyBLockedBalances[quote.partyB][quote.partyB][quote.partyA].addQuote(quote);
        }
```
## Impact
This vulnerability might cause discrepancies in the setting of the Maintenance Margin for MARKET orders, which in turn might affect the overall transaction and potentially lead to premature or unwarranted liquidation. Fixing the issue requires enforcing a condition where, in the case of MARKET orders, a position can be opened at the price requested by PartyA, stored in `quote.marketPrice`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address this vulnerability, it is necessary to enforce that PartyA's requested price, contained in `quote.marketPrice`, is used when opening a position for MARKET orders or add adjust logic when MARKET order.
