# Possible rounding errors in `deposit`, `withdraw`, `depositForPartyB` functions

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
From the code:
```solidity
uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
        (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());
```
The multiplication happens first, and then the result is divided. The rounding error could occur during the division operation if the result isn't a whole number, because Solidity truncates fractions when performing integer division.

## Impact
Solidity uses integer arithmetic and doesn't have built-in support for floating-point numbers.
This means that it automatically rounds down (truncates) any fractional values resulting from division operations, which can lead to rounding errors.
