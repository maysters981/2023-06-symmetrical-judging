# Repeated Registration of Party B

## Summary

The `registerPartyB` function in `ControlFacet.sol` allows for the repeated registration of the same `partyB` address.

## Vulnerability Detail

If a `partyB` address is already registered, the contract still allows for it to be registered again. Although the contract includes a `require` statement to check if the address is already registered, this does not prevent the address from being pushed to the `partyBList` again.

## Impact

An adversary could repeatedly register the same `partyB` address, causing the `partyBList` to be filled with duplicate entries, and potentially leading to denial of service or other unforeseen consequences.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function registerPartyB(
    address partyB
) external onlyRole(LibAccessibility.PARTY_B_MANAGER_ROLE) {
    require(
        !MAStorage.layout().partyBStatus[partyB],
        "ControlFacet: Address is already registered"
    );
    MAStorage.layout().partyBStatus[partyB] = true;
    MAStorage.layout().partyBList.push(partyB);
    emit RegisterPartyB(partyB);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It's recommended to implement a check to ensure a `partyB` address cannot be registered more than once.

## Proof Of Concept

```solidity
// Register partyB
await contractInstance.registerPartyB(partyB_address);

// Register partyB again
await contractInstance.registerPartyB(partyB_address); // Will not fail, causing duplicate entries
```
In this scenario, `partyB_address` is registered twice, resulting in duplicate entries.
