# Allocated balance can increase even if the account has been marked as liquidatable

## Summary

Once an account is marked as liquidatable, its allocated balance should not be altered. The invariant may be broken intentionally or accidentally by some users, that potentially result in some undesirable side effects or accounting errors.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol#L39

```solidity
File: AccountFacet.sol
39:     function allocate(
40:         uint256 amount
41:     ) external whenNotAccountingPaused notLiquidatedPartyA(msg.sender) {
42:         AccountFacetImpl.allocate(amount);
43:         emit AllocatePartyA(msg.sender, amount);
44:     }
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol#L66

```solidity
File: AccountFacet.sol
66:     function allocateForPartyB(
67:         uint256 amount,
68:         address partyA
69:     ) public whenNotPartyBActionsPaused notLiquidatedPartyB(msg.sender, partyA) onlyPartyB {
70:         AccountFacetImpl.allocateForPartyB(amount, partyA, true);
71:         emit AllocateForPartyB(msg.sender, partyA, amount);
72:     }
```

The `notLiquidatedPartyA` and `notLiquidatedPartyB` modifiers block users from allocated balance to their accounts if their accounts have been marked as liquidatable. Once an account is marked as liquidatable, its allocated balance should not be altered.

However, this invariant may be broken intentionally or accidentally by some users, that potentially result in some undesirable side effects.

If an address marked as liquidatable happens to be a liquidator that takes part in the liquidation of PartyA and PartyB, they will be entitled to a liquidation fee. In this case, their allocated balance will increase after the liquidation is completed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Review internally whether the integrity of its allocated balance must be intact once an account has been marked as liquidatable. If so, implement measures to check if the liquidator's address is tied to any user address marked as liquidatable, and prevent them from performing any liquidation.
