# Liquidation formula does not take pending locked balance into account

## Summary
While the technical doc states that pending locked balance should be considered in liquidation assessment, it is not in fact.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the technical doc, it states that pending locked balance will be a part in liquidity status assessment

```In order to grasp the intricacies of the liquidation process, a fundamental understanding of the 'pending locked' concept is crucial. When a user sends a quote request, the corresponding amount of the position goes into a 'pending' state. During this phase, the user is restricted from opening other positions with that specific amount. Nonetheless, this amount continues to contribute to the user's allocated funds when assessing their liquidity status. Once Party B opens the position, this amount goes from the 'pending' to the 'locked' state.``` - technical doc, can be found at: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/README.md#liquidation

However in the code, pending locked balance is not considered in calculating liquidation status:
