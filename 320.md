# no check for exipred Price Timestamp like in PartyB which can cause price staleness

## Summary
In PartyB liquidation `  priceSig.timestamp` is checked to be close to block.timstamp but in PartyA liquidation this is not checked which can cause some issues 
## Vulnerability Detail
The second step in liquidation for PartyA 
```solidity
        require(
            priceSig.timestamp <=
                maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
            "LiquidationFacet: Expired signature"
        );
```
Then for `setSymbolsPrices
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/6d2b64b6732fcfbd07c8217897dd233dbb6cd1f5/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L34
it doesn't check the sig for timestamp for `verifyPrice`  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/6d2b64b6732fcfbd07c8217897dd233dbb6cd1f5/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibMuon.sol#L34C5-L63C16
so A liquidator can use  an old price from a long timestamp and since its not checked it can cause profit for PartyA/PartyB and this can be dirrected at each party causing some of them loss 
Ex:
Liquidation happens at eth price 1000 at 20 timestamp
Now price is at 2000 at timestamp 40 but 20 is  still used and since there is no check PartyA has short So PartyB can get more profit than they should 
## Impact
Free profit for PartyB/PartyA 
## Code Snippet

```solidity 
function setSymbolsPrice(address partyA, PriceSig memory priceSig) internal {
        MAStorage.Layout storage maLayout = MAStorage.layout();
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
// @audit this dosnt check the timestmap like the other muon functions 
        LibMuon.verifyPrices(priceSig, partyA);
        require(maLayout.liquidationStatus[partyA], "LiquidationFacet: PartyA is solvent");
// @audit see here that chec is not good since timestmap can be below these      
   require(
            priceSig.timestamp <=
                maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
            "LiquidationFacet: Expired signature"
        );
        for (uint256 index = 0; index < priceSig.symbolIds.length; index++) {
            accountLayout.symbolsPrices[partyA][priceSig.symbolIds[index]] = Price(
                priceSig.prices[index],
                maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA]
            );
        }

        int256 availableBalance = LibAccount.partyAAvailableBalanceForLiquidation(
            priceSig.upnl,
            partyA
        );
        if (accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationType == LiquidationType.NONE) {
            accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA] = LiquidationDetail({
                liquidationType: LiquidationType.NONE,
                upnl: priceSig.upnl,
                totalUnrealizedLoss: priceSig.totalUnrealizedLoss,
                deficit: 0,
                liquidationFee: 0
            });
```

## Recommendation
Add timestmap check to muon or this: 
```solidity
 block.timestamp <= priceSig.timestamp + maLayout.liquidationTimeout, 
```
