# partyB cannot call openPosition more than once to completely fill a partially-filled order since quote.quoteStatus would become OPENED

## Summary
partyB cannot call openPosition more than once to completely fill a partially-filled order since quote.quoteStatus would become OPENED

## Vulnerability Detail
partyB is allowed to partially fill an order after locking the quote. However once partyB call `openPosition` to fill the order, regardless of the quantity; partyB cannot call openPosition again, since the status would turn into `OPENED` and no longer pass the status check

openPosition status check
```solidity 
    function openPosition(
        uint256 quoteId,
        uint256 filledAmount,
        uint256 openedPrice,
        PairUpnlAndPriceSig memory upnlSig
    ) internal returns (uint256 currentId) {
        QuoteStorage.Layout storage quoteLayout = QuoteStorage.layout();
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();

        Quote storage quote = quoteLayout.quotes[quoteId];
        require(
            quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.LOCKED ||
            quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.CANCEL_PENDING,
            "PartyBFacet: Invalid state"
        );
```

End of openPosition
```solidity
    function openPosition(
        uint256 quoteId,
....
....
        quote.quoteStatus = QuoteStatus.OPENED;
        LibQuote.addToOpenPositions(quoteId);
```

Based on how the function structures and create a new quote with updated quantity `quantity: quote.quantity - filledAmount`. It's reasonable to assume the system intends to permit partyB to fill at multiple transactions, so this is a issue if so.

## Impact
partyB could not split and fill a quote at multiple steps.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
consider allowing a quote of status `OPENED` to pass the openPosition check
```solidity
        require(
            quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.LOCKED ||
            quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.CANCEL_PENDING ||
++++            quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.OPENED,
            "PartyBFacet: Invalid state"
        );
```
