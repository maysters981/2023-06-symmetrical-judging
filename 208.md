# OpenZeppelin's `Ownable.sol` is wrongly implemented

## Summary

The OpenZeppelin library's `Ownable.sol` has recently undergone a significant change (from v4.9.0). Earlier, the contract owner was automatically designated as the account that deployed the contract. However, the new update requires the contract owner to be specified explicitly as a constructor argument during deployment. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The Openzeppelin version used in Symmetrical is `v 4.9.0` as seen from the contest repo's [package.json](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/6d2b64b6732fcfbd07c8217897dd233dbb6cd1f5/symmio-core/package.json#L20). Key to note that OpenZeppelin's `Ownable` contract is being implemented in the in scope [controlFactet.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/6d2b64b6732fcfbd07c8217897dd233dbb6cd1f5/symmio-core/contracts/facets/control/ControlFacet.sol#L7-L15) contract

Take a look at [setAdmin()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/6d2b64b6732fcfbd07c8217897dd233dbb6cd1f5/symmio-core/contracts/facets/control/ControlFacet.sol#L38C1-L41C6)

```solidity
import "../../utils/Ownable.sol";
...

contract ControlFacet is Accessibility, Ownable, IControlEvents {

...

    function setAdmin(address user) external onlyOwner {
        GlobalAppStorage.layout().hasRole[user][LibAccessibility.DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE] = true;
        emit RoleGranted(LibAccessibility.DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, user);
    }
...

```

As seen due to the breaking change in OZ's ownable.sol this function would be inaccessible.

## Impact

- Owner would be defaulted to 0x0
- The above essentially means that all `onlyOwner` prefixed functions in scope can't be accessed.

## Code Snippet

- [setAdmin()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/6d2b64b6732fcfbd07c8217897dd233dbb6cd1f5/symmio-core/contracts/facets/control/ControlFacet.sol#L38C1-L41C6)
- [controlFactet.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/6d2b64b6732fcfbd07c8217897dd233dbb6cd1f5/symmio-core/contracts/facets/control/ControlFacet.sol#L7-L15)
- [package.json](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/6d2b64b6732fcfbd07c8217897dd233dbb6cd1f5/symmio-core/package.json#L20)

## Tool used

- Manual Audit
- OZ contracts issues [tab](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues)

## Recommendation

Explicitly call to set the owner.
