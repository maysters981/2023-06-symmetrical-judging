# Quotes can be opened below the minimum quote value

## Summary
The system ensures that a quote issued by PartyA meets the minimum quote value requirement. However, when PartyB locks the quote at an opening price slightly lower than PartyA's requested price, the total locked quote value can fall below the minimum quote value.
## Vulnerability Detail
The situation arises when PartyA issues a quote, during which the system verifies that the quote's value meets or surpasses the minimum quote value before proceeding. However, when PartyB fully engages with the position, the combined locked quote value might fall short of the minimum quote value.

For instance, consider a scenario where the minimum quote value for ETH is $100. PartyA proposes a LIMIT quote with a desired opening price of $2000, and the total value locked in this quote is precisely $100.

PartyB then secures the quote at an opening price of $1999. The locked quote value then becomes 100 * 1999/2000 = $99.95, which is less than the minimum quote value for the ETH symbol.
