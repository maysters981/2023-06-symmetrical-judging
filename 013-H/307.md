# Both Partys can make `CloseQuote` revert by deallocate their funds and allowing the closing/liquidations to go threw

## Summary
When an actor wants to deallocate or allocate there is no check if their position is healthy or not before `closeQuote`
## Vulnerability Detail
3 scenarios
1.PartyB allocates and then  deallocates before the force closing of the position  and they get out that loss, PartyA won't be able to close their position besides liquidation but PartyB won't have funds  to even liquidate 
`allocate` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/6d2b64b6732fcfbd07c8217897dd233dbb6cd1f5/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L41

ex: PartyB needs 2500 tokens  to make this position not liquidatable, so he allocates that much and then   deallocates most of his funds and since that happens below the  code will revert 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibQuote.sol#L176
as you can see since if remove the allocated, the Upnl will revert causing force close not to happen and PartyA funds to be stuck and sit in the protocol
The only other  requirement is that Upnl would have to be  more than the funds left `allocatedBalances` over after PartyB deallocated 
```solidity
     LibMuon.verifyPartyBUpnl(upnlSig, msg.sender, partyA);
        int256 availableBalance = LibAccount.partyBAvailableForQuote(
            upnlSig.upnl,
            msg.sender,
            partyA
        );
```
2. Here  PartyA does the same thing but waits until Pnl is in his favor and gains free profit 
3. In emergency mode PartyB can try to close PartyA's position but PartyA deallocates which   would cause  a Break in the assumed spec and plus PartyA won't be able to be liquidated/position won't be able to be emergency closed 
## Impact
as said above with the right risky position and large enough pnl with smaller  partys'  it will cause reverts which would affect how those positions are handled which can make those funds stuck/free profit 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function deallocateForPartyB(
        uint256 amount,
        address partyA,
        SingleUpnlSig memory upnlSig
    ) internal {
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        require(
            accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[msg.sender][partyA] >= amount,
            "PartyBFacet: Insufficient locked balance"
        );
        LibMuon.verifyPartyBUpnl(upnlSig, msg.sender, partyA);
        int256 availableBalance = LibAccount.partyBAvailableForQuote(
            upnlSig.upnl,
            msg.sender,
            partyA
        );
```
`closeQuote`

```solidity
      if (hasMadeProfit) {
            accountLayout.allocatedBalances[quote.partyA] += pnl;
            accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][quote.partyA] -= pnl;
        } else {
            accountLayout.allocatedBalances[quote.partyA] -= pnl;  
            accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][quote.partyA] += pnl;
        }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The main issue here is that the protocol allows for some deallocating before an important function with no solvent function checking after what the state of the actor is at

 Add a solvent function to  allocate and deallocate so that PartyA/PartyB can't get out of any commitment/quotes
like  after the deallocating check: `PartyAForLiquidation>0 passes`
