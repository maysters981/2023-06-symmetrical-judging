# deallocate() Lack of consideration for partyB deficits

## Summary
`deallocate () ` will take  `partyA.unpl` as the amount of money that can be deallocated
However, the current protocol does not consider whether the corresponding `partyB` is in a serious deficit
As a result, when drastic price changes, `unpl` becomes large 
`partyA`  may illegally deallocate additional funds

## Vulnerability Detail

As an example, suppose partyA has two quotes: (for simplicity,  ignore cva, lf)
quote[1] = {partyB=B , lockedBalances = 100}
quote[2] = {partyB=C, lockedBalances = 100}
allocatedBalances[partyA] = 200
allocatedBalances[partyA][partyB] = 100
allocatedBalances[partyA][partyC] = 100

Due to the sharp decline in price, suppose quote [1] .npl =+ 300, quote [2] .unpl = - 100    
partyA Profit + 200, but since `allocatedBalances[partyA] [partyB]` is only 100, it is a serious deficit

But `partyA` can still get all `allocatedBalances [partyA]` through  `deallocate ()`
Because the current number of deallocatable is:
`allocatedBalances [partyA] + partyA.upnl - lockedBalances [partyA] `
= 200 + (300-100) - 200
= 200

After taking allocatedBalances [partyA] = 0, so that `partyC ` cannot be profitable normally


## Impact
illegally deallocate additional funds

Manual Review

## Recommendation

At present, `crypto_v3.js` does not take into account the problem of `partyB` deficit when calculating the `partyA.unpl`, so it is inaccurate to use `partyA.unpl`
This will have problems in other places when uses `partyA.unpl `
Suggest  `partyA.unpl` calculation needs to be added to take into account `partyB` deficit
