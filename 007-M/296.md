# Party B liquidations are not incentivized if the losses exceed the locked liquidation possibly resulting in not liquidating Party B and Party A not receiving the liquidation proceeds

## Summary

Liquidation fees for liquidating an insolvent Party B are not always paid to the liquidator, failing to incentivize liquidations if the losses of Party B (i.e., `availableBalance` is negative) surpass the locked liquidation fee.

## Vulnerability Detail

A liquidator liquidating an insolvent Party B [receives a liquidation fee](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L303-L305). This fee is initially locked in Party B's locked balance when the quote is locked.

However, the liquidator's share (i.e., the fee) remains zero if the losses of Party B are greater than the locked liquidation fee ([`else` branch in line 268](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L268-L270)). Effectively, missing to incentivize liquidators to liquidate such a Party B.

This issue becomes significant considering that the protocol selects and allowlists liquidators. Thus, Party A (who would have an interest in liquidating Party B) can not simply step in in and carry out the liquidation.

## Impact

As liquidations are time critical, having no incentives (i.e., liquidation fee) paid to liquidators to liquidate a deeply insolvent Party B, liquidators could refrain from liquidating such a Party B and the corresponding Party A not [receiving the liquidation proceeds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L294-L296) (`partyBAllocatedBalances`).

## Recommendation

Consider always paying a liquidation fee to the liquidator to incentivize liquidations in any case.
