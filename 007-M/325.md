# we never pop of `liquiditor` from the array causing no incentives  for liquiditor after the first liquidation in the system in `liquidatePositionsPartyA`

## Summary
we don't pop of the liquidator array which is not supposed to happen 
## Vulnerability Detail
since we never pop the index  of the array the next time user gets liquidated the liquidator will be address (0) which should not be
The impact  is that there is no incentive for the liquidator to liquidate and its breaks the spec in the system that anyone can become a liquidator and possibly get rewards 
steps:
1. First liquidation goes well and liquidators are deleted 
2. the second liquidation will reward address(0)

## Impact
as I said above this is not supposed to be its direct brake of the spec and rewards will be lost/stuck when the liquidator though they were getting rewards 
## Code Snippet
```solidity

       if (lf > 0) {
       	// @audit [0] and [1] liquidity after the first liquidation will be address(0) 
                accountLayout.allocatedBalances[accountLayout.liquidators[partyA][0]] += lf / 2;
                accountLayout.allocatedBalances[accountLayout.liquidators[partyA][1]] += lf / 2;
            }
            // we dont pop off the liquidators in the function instead we just set it to 0 address
            delete accountLayout.liquidators[partyA];


```

## Recommendation
add poping  for the liquidator its as simple as that
