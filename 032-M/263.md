# Liquidation can incorrectly set partyA balance as 0

## Summary
During partyA liquidation, the balance of partyA is always set to 0. There can be cases where this is wrong and partyA should have a small amount of funds left.

## Vulnerability Detail
During the last step of liquidation process, partyA's allocated balance is set to 0

However, this may not always be correct as liquidation is a multi-step process and uses two different price signatures.

First step of liquidation process confirms that user balance is negative and therefore user can be liquidated. The check is performed based on Muon signature passed as an argument (let's call it *Sig1*).
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L20

On the next step liquidator sets symbol prices which are to be used later when liquidating user positions.

This is again based on a Muon price signature (*Sig2*) that needs to be within a liquidation timeout from the original liquidation call. One can see that this signature can be different from *Sig1*. 

*Sig1* is used to allow us to liquidate the user but *Sig2* is the one that actual balance changes rely upon. It is possible that price differences between *Sig1* and *Sig2* and just enough to make partyA balance positive. In this case, after liquidation is finished, they need to have some leftover amount on the account.

**Example**

- Let's say partyA has a balance of 100 and a single position with PnL of -101 when liquidation happens.
- On step 2, when setting symbols, such prices are used that PnL becomes -99
- On step 4 we transfer 99 coins to partyB and nullify the balance of partyA
- 1 coin is lost as a result

## Impact
Loss of funds during liquidation. This scenario is likely to happen once in a while depending on the length of the liquidation timeout.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend using availableBalance as calculated in `setSymbolsPrice` and assign this value to partyA's allocatedBalance in the end https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L52
