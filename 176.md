# Invalid symbol can be used in a open quote

## Summary

Invalid symbol can be used in a open quote.

## Vulnerability Detail

Every time Party A sends a quote, the [Symbol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/storages/SymbolStorage.sol#L7-L14) for the quote is validated to prevent from invalid **Symbol** being used.
```solidity
        require(symbolLayout.symbols[symbolId].isValid, "PartyAFacet: Symbol is not valid");
```
However, when quote is being opened, **Symbol** state is not validated any more, this is risky as **Symbol** state can be changed by **SYMBOL_MANAGER_ROLE**.
```solidity
    function setSymbolValidationState(
        uint256 symbolId,
        bool isValid
    ) external onlyRole(LibAccessibility.SYMBOL_MANAGER_ROLE) {
        SymbolStorage.Layout storage symbolLayout = SymbolStorage.layout();
        require(symbolId >= 1 && symbolId <= symbolLayout.lastId, "ControlFacet: Invalid id");
        emit SetSymbolValidationState(symbolId, symbolLayout.symbols[symbolId].isValid, isValid);
        symbolLayout.symbols[symbolId].isValid = isValid;
    }
```
If in any case the **Symbol** state is changed during the period in which quote is sent and opened, the quote will be opened with an invalid **Symbol**.

## Impact

Invalid symbolId is used in a open quote.

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, consider validating  **Symbol** state when quote being opened.
