# A suspended PartyA can bypass withdrawal restriction and exit with funds

## Summary

A suspended PartyA can bypass withdrawal restriction by colluding with a counterparty.

## Vulnerability Detail

A PartyA is not expected to withdraw his funds, calling [withdraw(...)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol#L26-L29) method will be reverted due to [notSuspended](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/utils/Accessibility.sol#L73-L79) modifier:
```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external whenNotAccountingPaused notSuspended(msg.sender) {
        AccountFacetImpl.withdraw(msg.sender, amount);
        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
```solidity
    modifier notSuspended(address user) {
        require(
            !AccountStorage.layout().suspendedAddresses[user],
            "Accessibility: Sender is Suspended"
        );
        _;
    }
```
However, a suspended PartyA can bypass the restriction by colluding with a PartyB:
1. PartyA has a pending quote before getting suspended
2. PartyB locks and opens a position for the old quote
3. PartyA (request to) close it in a way that he is in huge loss and PartyB in huge profit
4. PartyB withdraws and tranfers funds back to PartyA, PartyA thus exits with funds.

## Impact

Withdrawal restriction is bypassed and a suspended PartyA can exit with funds.
