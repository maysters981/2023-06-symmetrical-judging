# Party A can be liquidated with outdated price data

## Summary

Party A can be liquidated with outdated price data.

## Vulnerability Detail

`LiquidationFacetImpl.liquidatePositionsPartyA` does not update the nonce of party A after the liquidation process is completed.

This can be used for a malicious liquidator to perform a "griefing" attack on party A, by using outdated uPnL data to initiate a new liquidation process.

The sequence of events would be the following:

1. Party A is in the process of liquidation. The liquidator requests off-chain for a uPnL signature for party A, that will reflect the insolvency of party A.
2. The liquidator calls `liquidatePositionsPartyA` to complete the liquidation process of party A. Now party A is not insolvent anymore.
3. The liquidator uses the uPnL signature from step 1 to initiate a new liquidation process of party A, by calling `liquidatePartyA`. The uPnL signature is valid, because the nonce of party A has not been updated and its timestamp is recent enough. However, this uPnL will reflect the insolvency of party A before the liquidation process of step 2 was completed, instead of the current state of party A.

Although there is no direct economic loss for party A, this can be used to grief party A by locking the account until the liquidation process is completed.

## Impact

A malicious liquidator can grief party A by locking the account until the liquidation process is completed.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Increment the nonce of party A after the liquidation process is completed.
