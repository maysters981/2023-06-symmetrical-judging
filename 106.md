# PartyBFacetImpl.openPosition doesn't scale quote.lockedValues for fully fulfilled market orders

## Summary
PartyBFacetImpl.openPosition doesn't scale quote.lockedValues for fully fulfilled market orders
## Vulnerability Detail
When position is open then the price can be [not the same as requested by user](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L136-L146).

For this reason it should be scaled, to block correct amount of user funds. This is [done for the limit order](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L136-L146) when `quote.quantity == filledAmount`. `quote.lockedValues` is scaled according to execute price and then [locked balance is updated for partyA and partyB](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L164-L166).
Also [it's done for both market and limit orders](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L178-L185), when they are not fulfilled fully

The problem that this should also be done for market orders that are fulfilled, because the price for them can be also not same as `quote.requestedOpenPrice`.

As result wrong amount will be locked for both partyA and partyB which can create insolvency.
## Impact
Wrong amount will be locked for both partyA and partyB which can create insolvency
