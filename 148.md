# User funds are locked forever because no one can complete the liquidation

## Summary
`liquidationTimeout` is initialized in `ControlFacet.sol` to `600`

## Vulnerability Detail
In case [setSymbolsPrice()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L34-L44) reverted with `LiquidationFacet: Expired signature`
so the `liquidationTimeout` is reached and no one can continue the liquidation process or use a new signature to update the `maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA]` in `liquidatePartyA()` because this `notLiquidatedPartyA(partyA)` modifier will revert 

## Impact
- The liquidation will stack in this phase and no one can invoke `setSymbolsPrice()` to continue it.
- Both PartyA and PartyB have no power over their funds and positions 
- User funds are locked forever

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add some logic to reset the `maLayout.liquidationStatus[partyA]` to `false` in this case
