# Access Control: PartyB can close suspended users positions

## Summary

Malicious users are suspended from participation in the protocol through setSuspendedAddress(). Since their account has been suspended, activities such as closing existing positions should be prevented. 

## Vulnerability Detail

If a user has been suspended, but has pending close requests their positions can be closed through partyB fillCloseRequest(). This is due to the fact that the function does not ensure that partyA of the quoteID being closed is not a suspended user. 

## Impact

PartyB will close suspended users positions as the function assumes the close request is for non-suspended users. The impact of this is that it gives a suspended user access to functions they should not have access to via PartyB in this instance.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Include a condition that ensures partyA of quote is not a suspended user. This can be achieved using the function `isSuspended` declared in ViewFacet.sol


```solidity

    function fillCloseRequest(
        uint256 quoteId,
        uint256 filledAmount,
        uint256 closedPrice,
        PairUpnlAndPriceSig memory upnlSig
    ) external whenNotPartyBActionsPaused onlyPartyBOfQuote(quoteId) notLiquidated(quoteId) {
        Quote storage quote = QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId];
        
     if(isSuspended(quote.partyA){
       revert("Cannot fill close request for suspended user");

      }
        
        PartyBFacetImpl.fillCloseRequest(quoteId, filledAmount, closedPrice, upnlSig);
    
        emit FillCloseRequest(
            quoteId,
            quote.partyA,
            quote.partyB,
            filledAmount,
            closedPrice,
            quote.quoteStatus
        );
    }
