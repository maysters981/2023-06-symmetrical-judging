# Immediate liquidation of partyA

## Summary
In the existing system, a party (Party A) could face immediate liquidation right after they submit their quote. This is because when Party A proposes an opening price, Party B can initiate the position at a different price as long as it passes the validation checks by the smart contract. This could result in a situation where Party A gets liquidated instantly, regardless of their position or the current price.
## Vulnerability Detail
At present, an entity, Party A, can face immediate liquidation right after submitting their quote. The request for an opening price is made by Party A, but Party B can open the position at a different price, as long as it passes contract validation checks. This could potentially lead to a scenario where Party A is immediately liquidated, irrespective of the position or current price.

Consider a scenario where Alice has $10K locked in balances, and she creates a short position for 2 ETH at $2000, while the current price of ETH is also $2000. Alice's cva for this quote is $2000, her lf is $100, and she also has $10K in allocated balances. Let's say the order is a LIMIT order.

Bob, the partyB of the Alices' order needs to put significant amount of funds to his balances such that the LibSolvency.isSolventAfterOpenPosition does not reverts due to underflow. Since this attack will be handled in few blocks, Bob should be OK depositing big funds. 

First check the Bob will encounter in the function is the following code snippet:

```solidity
else if (quote.positionType == PositionType.SHORT) {
            if (quote.openedPrice >= upnlSig.price) {
                uint256 diff = (filledAmount * (quote.openedPrice - upnlSig.price)) / 1e18;
                uint256 max = diff > lockedMM ? diff : lockedMM;
                require(
                    partyBAvailableBalance - int256(max) >= 0,
                    "LibSolvency: PartyB will be liquidatable"
                );
                require(
                    partyAAvailableBalance + int256(diff) - int256(lockedMM) >= 0,
                    "LibSolvency: PartyA will be liquidatable"
                );
```
`diff` will be 2 * 8000 = 16K, disregard decimals.
say the max is also 16K, meaning that the locked mm is lesser than the diff.

as long as Bob has some allocated balance bigger than 16K$ for Alice the first require will be bypassed.
Second require will also be bypassed since the diff > lockedMM it will be bigger than 0 overall.

Following the library check,  the execution of the following lines of code in openPosition will be next:

```solidity
if (quote.quantity == filledAmount) {
            accountLayout.pendingLockedBalances[quote.partyA].subQuote(quote);
            accountLayout.partyBPendingLockedBalances[quote.partyB][quote.partyA].subQuote(quote);

            if (quote.orderType == OrderType.LIMIT) {
                quote.lockedValues.mul(openedPrice).div(quote.requestedOpenPrice);
            }
            accountLayout.lockedBalances[quote.partyA].addQuote(quote);
            accountLayout.partyBLockedBalances[quote.partyB][quote.partyA].addQuote(quote);
        }
```

As we see, the quote values are updated, first multiplied by the price Bob gave which is 10K and then divided by the requested open price 2K, which effectively multiplies the quote values by 5. The quotes new cva is 10K$ and new lf is 500$ and the margin maintenance (mm) is 5x from previous. Also, this is the new locked balance for Alice and Bob in the storage layout.

Now, Bob can call liquidatePartyA flow and liquidate Alice.

Party A available liquidatable balance is calculated as follows:

```solidity
function partyAAvailableBalanceForLiquidation(
        int256 upnl,
        address partyA
    ) internal view returns (int256) {
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        int256 freeBalance = int256(accountLayout.allocatedBalances[partyA]) -
            int256(
                accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].cva + accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].lf // @audit this is not free balance
            );
        return freeBalance + upnl;
    }
```
We can disregard the unrealized profit and loss (upnl) here because we are assuming Bob calls the liquidation right away. So, let's assume the price of ETH is very near 2000$, let's say the profit is 1$. So, the price of ETH is 1990$'ish.
Now since Bob made Alice's locked cva and lf higher than it was, this formula will be calculated as follows:
10K - (10K + 500) + 1= -499, which means Alice is liquidatable.

Now, this if block will be executed since (abs(-499) < 500)

```solidity
else if (uint256(-availableBalance) < accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].lf) {
                uint256 remainingLf = accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].lf -
                    uint256(-availableBalance);
                accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationType = LiquidationType.NORMAL;
                accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationFee = remainingLf;
```

That means the liquidation fee is 1 and liquidationType is NORMAL.

at last, these lines will be executed and Bob will secure the entire inflated cva of Alice

```solidity
if (
                accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationType == LiquidationType.NORMAL
            ) {
                accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA] += quote
                    .lockedValues
                    .cva;
                if (hasMadeProfit) {
                    accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA] -= amount;
                } else {
                    accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA] += amount;
                }
```
Bob gets the 10K cva to his allocated balances as well as the lf, Alice loses everything. 

## Impact
As long as Bob first bypasses the isSolvent check in openPosition by depositing more, Bob can exploit every short position just like this. I'll label it as high
