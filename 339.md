# Division with large numbers results in zero

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Division by large numbers may result in the result being zero, due to solidity not supporting fractions. 

## Impact
If denominator value is larger than numerator it will result in zero that will cause the transfer to made in value of zero instead of actual value.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider requiring a minimum amount for the numerator to ensure that it is always larger than the denominator.
