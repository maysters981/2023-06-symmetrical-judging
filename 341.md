# Some tokens may revert when zero value transfers are made

## Summary
Zero value transfers can revert for some tokens 
## Vulnerability Detail
In spite of the fact that EIP-20 [states](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/46b9b698815abbfa628cd1097311deee77dd45c5/EIPS/eip-20.md?plain=1#L116) that zero-valued transfers needs to be accepted, zero transfer reverts for some tokens.

## Impact
Some tokens will revert if zero transfer is attempted, which may cause transactions that involve other tokens to fully revert.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider skipping transfer if the amount is zero, will also save gas required for transaction.
