# Liquidator may receive incorrect fee in party B liquidation due to party A liquidation interference

## Summary

When party B is in the process of liquidation and party A is also liquidated, the liquidator may receive an incorrect liquidation fee.

## Vulnerability Detail

The liquidation of party B involves two stages: `liquidatePartyB` and `liquidatePositionsPartyB`. These are two different (no atomic) transactions.

- In stage 1 - `liquidatePartyB`, the `partyBPositionLiquidatorsShare` is calculated by the formula `(remainingLf - liquidatorShare)/partyBPositionsCount` (which is the average of lf per position)

        maLayout.partyBPositionLiquidatorsShare[partyB][partyA] =
            (remainingLf - liquidatorShare) /
            quoteLayout.partyBPositionsCount[partyB][partyA];

- In stage 2: the liquidator receives the amount `partyBPositionLiquidatorsShare` * number of liquidation quotes.

        accountLayout.allocatedBalances[msg.sender] +=
            maLayout.partyBPositionLiquidatorsShare[partyB][partyA] *
            priceSig.quoteIds.length;

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L374-L376

The issue is that party A can be liquidated while party B is in the liquidation process.

If party A is liquidated and completed between stage 1 and stage 2 of party Bâ€™s liquidation (party B stage 1 -> party A liquidate position -> party B stage 2), and party A has a position with party B, then the `partyBPositionLiquidatorsShare` does not reflect the correct Lf per outstanding B position because when party A is liquidated, it reduces the `partyBPositionsCount` and adjusts the `partyBAllocatedBalances`.

        quoteLayout.partyBPositionsCount[quote.partyB][partyA] -= 1;

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L163-L197

Therefore, the liquidator in stage 2 receives `partyBPositionLiquidatorsShare` which is outdated.

## Impact

The liquidator in stage 2 may receive an incorrect amount of liquidation fee.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When party B is liquidating in stage 1, change the status to `LIQUIDATING` and prevent party A from liquidating this position.
