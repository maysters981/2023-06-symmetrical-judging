# AccountFacetImpl -> withdraw function doesn't check for balance

## Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L27
`AccountFacetImpl` library doesn't check the caller's balance to see if it's greater than the passed amount that they want to withdraw

## Vulnerability Detail

In `AccountFacet.sol` contract user can call withdraw function and pass the amount they want to withdraw as an argument and the call will be forwarded to withdraw function of  `AccountFacetImpl.sol` library to send the inputed amount to user **But** the function does not check if msg.sender has enough balance compare to the amount they passed;
This means anyone without any balance can call withdraw and **drain all of the tokens available inside the contract** since there is no check for the balance.

## Impact

1. Attacker call withdraw on `AccountFacet` contract and pass all of the amount available in contract and the contract forward the call to libarary's withdraw function
2. the function checks `withdrawCooldown`   and  `deallocateCooldown` but since they are `0` by default and there is no check for caller's balance it passes the first requirment and sends inputed amount to caller successfuly.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function withdraw(address user, uint256 amount) internal {
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        GlobalAppStorage.Layout storage appLayout = GlobalAppStorage.layout();
        require(
            block.timestamp >=
            accountLayout.withdrawCooldown[msg.sender] + MAStorage.layout().deallocateCooldown,
            "AccountFacet: Cooldown hasn't reached"
        );
        uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
        (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());
        accountLayout.balances[msg.sender] -= amountWith18Decimals;
        IERC20(appLayout.collateral).safeTransfer(user, amount);
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

For fixing this problem you need to require caller's balance be higher or equal to the amount that he/she want to withdraw.

here is an example :

```solidity
    function withdraw(address user, uint256 amount) internal {
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        GlobalAppStorage.Layout storage appLayout = GlobalAppStorage.layout();
        uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
        (10 ** IERC20Metadata(appLayout.collateral).decimals());

        require(amountWith18Decimals <= accountLayout.balances[msg.sender],"insufficient funds")
        
        require(
            block.timestamp >=
            accountLayout.withdrawCooldown[msg.sender] + MAStorage.layout().deallocateCooldown,
            "AccountFacet: Cooldown hasn't reached"
        );

        accountLayout.balances[msg.sender] -= amountWith18Decimals;
        IERC20(appLayout.collateral).safeTransfer(user, amount);
    }
```
