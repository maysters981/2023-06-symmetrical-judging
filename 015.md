# Arithmetic Underflow in `requestToCancelQuote` function.

## Summary

An arithmetic underflow vulnerability is present in the `requestToCancelQuote` function of the `PartyAFacetImpl.sol` smart contract, potentially leading to unexpected outcomes when substracting the quote.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `requestToCancelQuote` function from the `PartyAFacetImpl.sol` contract tries to decrease `accountLayout.partyANonces[quote.partyA]` value without checking if the result could be below zero. This could potentially lead to underflows, which in Solidity wrap around, resulting in large balances.

```solidity
if (block.timestamp > quote.deadline) {
    result = LibQuote.expireQuote(quoteId);
} else if (quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.PENDING) {
    quote.quoteStatus = QuoteStatus.CANCELED;
    LibQuote.returnTradingFee(quoteId);
    accountLayout.pendingLockedBalances[quote.partyA].subQuote(quote); // Potential Underflow
    LibQuote.removeFromPartyAPendingQuotes(quote);
    result = QuoteStatus.CANCELED;
}
```

## Impact

An attacker could take advantage of this vulnerability to artificially inflate their balance, which could lead to the theft of all funds in the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Always perform subtraction operations using a safe subtraction function such as `SafeMath.sub()` that includes checks for underflows and overflows. Alternatively, use the built-in overflow and underflow checks in Solidity 0.8.x.

## Proof Of Concept

To reproduce this vulnerability:

1. Deploy the contract.
2. Call the `requestToCancelQuote` function, passing a valid `quoteId`.
3. Before the transaction completes, decrease the `quote.partyA` nonce to 0.
4. Observe that the subtraction operation results in an underflow, wrapping around to a large value.
