# `partyBNonces` is incorrectly accounted in `lockQuote` (it'll use `partyB` = address(0))

## Summary
`partyBNonces` is incorrectly accounted in `lockQuote` . Instead of incrementing `partyBNonces[B][A]++` , it'll increment `partyBNonces[address(0)][A]` . 

## Vulnerability Detail
1. When partyA `sendQuote` , the `quote` object will be initialized with `quote.partyB = address(0)` (see  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L105 )
2. Then when partyB wants to `lockQuote` , the `quote.partyB` is still unchanged (still address(0)), so the nonce increment will remain unchanged.

## Impact
- `PartyBNonces` will be accounted incorrectly and misbehave, which can cause nonce conflict and complex replay attack.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Move the nonce increment to after the `quote.partyB = msg.sender` assignment (or directly use msg.sender in the increment).
