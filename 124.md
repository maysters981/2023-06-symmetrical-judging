# PartyBFacetImpl.acceptCancelRequest function doesn't increase nonce for partyA

## Summary
PartyBFacetImpl.acceptCancelRequest function doesn't increase nonce for partyA.
## Vulnerability Detail
When quote is locked and partyA asks to cancel quote, then partyB can call `PartyBFacetImpl.acceptCancelRequest`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L59-L73
```solidity
    function acceptCancelRequest(uint256 quoteId) internal {
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();


        Quote storage quote = QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId];
        require(quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.CANCEL_PENDING, "PartyBFacet: Invalid state");
        accountLayout.partyBNonces[quote.partyB][quote.partyA] += 1;
        quote.modifyTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        quote.quoteStatus = QuoteStatus.CANCELED;
        accountLayout.pendingLockedBalances[quote.partyA].subQuote(quote);
        accountLayout.partyBPendingLockedBalances[quote.partyB][quote.partyA].subQuote(quote);
        // send trading Fee back to partyA
        LibQuote.returnTradingFee(quoteId);


        LibQuote.removeFromPendingQuotes(quote);
    }
```

This function changes pending locked balances for partyB and partyA and also refunds some fees to partyA.
Because balances has changed, nonce for partyB is increased, so old signatures can't be used anymore. The same should be done for partyA, because it's balance also has changed.
## Impact
Old signatures still will be valid for partyA, which can lead to wrong calculations.

Increase partyA nonce.
