# A partyA can Dos a partyB's `emergencyClose` call indefinetely

## Summary
A partyA can Dos a partyB's `emergencyClose` call indefinetely

## Vulnerability Detail
We can see that `emergencyClose` for a partyB relies on a nonced signature, which is fetched directly from the on-chain value:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L313

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibMuon.sol#L161-L190

however, since partyA can increment this value indefinitely by sending a quote and cancelling it:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L87

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L130

partyA can prevent a partyB to ever have a valid signature to proceed with the emergency closing by doing one of these operations at every block.

## Impact
partyA can prevent the emergency close of a partyB undefinitely, keeping their funds locked.

## Recommendation
Do not rely on partyA's nonce for the signature of this operation
