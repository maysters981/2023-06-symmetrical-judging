# `diamondCut()` allows re-execution of old updates

## Summary
The function `diamondCut()` of `LibDiamond.sol` verifies the signed version of the update parameters. It checks the signed version is available. However it doesnâ€™t prevent multiple executions and the signed version stays valid forever. 

## Vulnerability Detail
This allows old updates to be executed again. Assume the following:
- facet_x (or function_y) has value: version_1.
- then: replace facet_x (or function_y) with version_2.
- then a bug is found in version_2 and it is rolled back with: replace facet_x (or function_y) with version_1.
- then a (malicious) owner could immediately do: replace facet_x (or function_y) with version_2 (because it is still valid).

File: LibDiamond.sol
    function diamondCut(
        IDiamondCut.FacetCut[] memory _diamondCut,
        address _init,
        bytes memory _calldata
    ) internal {
        for (uint256 facetIndex; facetIndex < _diamondCut.length; facetIndex++) {
            IDiamondCut.FacetCutAction action = _diamondCut[facetIndex].action;
            if (action == IDiamondCut.FacetCutAction.Add) {
                addFunctions(
                    _diamondCut[facetIndex].facetAddress,
                    _diamondCut[facetIndex].functionSelectors
                );
            } else if (action == IDiamondCut.FacetCutAction.Replace) {
                replaceFunctions(
                    _diamondCut[facetIndex].facetAddress,
                    _diamondCut[facetIndex].functionSelectors
                );
            } else if (action == IDiamondCut.FacetCutAction.Remove) {
                removeFunctions(
                    _diamondCut[facetIndex].facetAddress,
                    _diamondCut[facetIndex].functionSelectors
                );
            } else {
                revert("LibDiamondCut: Incorrect FacetCutAction");
            }
        }
        emit DiamondCut(_diamondCut, _init, _calldata);
        initializeDiamondCut(_init, _calldata);
    }
```

## Impact
`diamondCut()` allows re-execution of old updates
Note: the risk is limited because it can only executed by the contract owner, however this is probably not how the mechanism should work

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider doing the following:
- Add a validity period for updates;
- Remember which updates have been executed and prevent re-execution;
- Add a nonce (for cases where a re-execution is wanted)
