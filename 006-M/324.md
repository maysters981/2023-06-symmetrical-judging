# DOS for accounts if liquidation expires.

## Summary
For an account being liquidated, there is a liquidation deadline which causes a spiral of reverts which effectively causes DOS to the address. 
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function liquidatePartyA(address partyA, SingleUpnlSig memory upnlSig) internal {
        MAStorage.Layout storage maLayout = MAStorage.layout();

        LibMuon.verifyPartyAUpnl(upnlSig, partyA);
        int256 availableBalance = LibAccount.partyAAvailableBalanceForLiquidation(
            upnlSig.upnl,
            partyA
        );
        require(availableBalance < 0, "LiquidationFacet: PartyA is solvent");
        maLayout.liquidationStatus[partyA] = true;
        maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA] = upnlSig.timestamp;
        AccountStorage.layout().liquidators[partyA].push(msg.sender);
    }
```
One of the values being passed in is the upnlSig.timestamp whuch is used to set the expiration period. The issue here is that once the timestamp for the signature expiration passes after this function is called, there is no way for the user to restart liquidation, the bot cannot restart liquidation as well. funds would be permanently stuck but not liquiated.
Because 
- ``` function liquidatePartyA``` starts liquidation, sets the timestamp and the status

- If liquidation expires before ```function setSymbolsPrice``` is called then it would revert here:

- if we attempt to call ```function liquidatePositionsPartyA```  without  ```function setSymbolsPrice```  it reverts because these values which were to be set in  ```function setSymbolsPrice``` were not set
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L144-L148

- If we attempt to start liquidation again it reverts as well because the account is in the liquidating stage

## Impact
Once liquidation signature expires, it can never be fulfilled and it causes DOS for the user as well as permanently locked funds in the contract
And it was stated here that all roles are trusted except for the LIQUIDATOR_ROLE meaning it can go offline, or there can be issues that lead to this exact scenario happening

## Recommendation
Create a function that can be used to reinitialized expired liquidations
