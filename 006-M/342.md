# If liquiation is not called in few blocks/timestmaps PartyB other positions can't be liquidated and funds will stuck  in ` liquidatePositionsPartyB`

## Summary
because something of the chain can go down/ or just bad incentives it can cause timestamp to go below what the liquidation check needs  as shown below 
## Vulnerability Detail
If liquidation for PartyB is not called in few changes of block.timestamp for monetary reasons of the chain is down/ no incentives 
PartyB won't be able to get out of the liquidation state and that Opened Position won't be able to be liquidated 
steps:
PartyB gets liquidated 
The liquidator makes a call to liquidate 10/20 positions 
3 blocks later
Liquidator calls the function and it reverts since `partyBLiquidationTimestamp`+ timeout so ex : block.timestamp is at 5 and timstamp at first check is 8 and timestamp happens something happens and `priceSig.timestmap + timeout ` >= block.timstamp
ex: 9 in the first check which would make the call revert since block.timestamp is already at 10 
## Impact
PartyA/PartyB won't be able to use the protocol and funds will be stuck in limbo which if you have huge PartyB and some external chain issue happens or if its just luck then Funds will be stuck and dos for the Partys Which should not happen 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
        require(
            priceSig.timestamp <=
                maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout, // @audit H-25
            "LiquidationFacet: Expired signature"
        );
        require(
            maLayout.partyBLiquidationStatus[partyB][partyA],
            "LiquidationFacet: PartyB is solvent"
        );
        require(
            block.timestamp <= priceSig.timestamp + maLayout.liquidationTimeout, // @audit M-03
            "LiquidationFacet: Expired pric sig"
        );

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add another function for dealing with that edge case or let admin come in and do something like remove that check
a better way would to allow PartyB to get liquidted again and not allow the nonLiquidated  check on the first PartyB liquidation function
