# liquidatePositionsPartyB could be permanently blocked

## Summary

Due to some required invariants on the timestamp and timeout, `liquidatePositionsPartyB` could be permanently blocked.

## Vulnerability Detail

When liquidation of PartyB is started, the liquidation timestamp is set as the signature's timestamp.

```solidity
    /* LiquidationFacetImpl.sol # liquidatePartyB */
        maLayout.partyBLiquidationStatus[partyB][partyA] = true;
        maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] = upnlSig.timestamp;
```

Then, to liquidate the remaining open positions of PartyB, there are some requirements on the timestamp.
```solidity
    /* LiquidationFacetImpl.sol # liquidatePositionsPartyB */
        // priceSig.timestamp <= partyBLiquidationTimestamp + liquidationTimeout
        require(
            priceSig.timestamp <=
                maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
            "LiquidationFacet: Expired signature"
        );

        // block.timestamp - liquidationTimeout <= priceSig.timestamp
        require(
            block.timestamp <= priceSig.timestamp + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
            "LiquidationFacet: Expired price sig"
        );

        // block.timestamp - liquidationTimeout <= priceSig.timestamp
        //  <= partyBLiquidationTimestamp + liquidationTimeout
```

From the invariant, we can conclude that `block.timestamp <= partyBLiquidationTimestamp + 2 * liquidationTimeout`.
That is, if `liquidatePositionsPartyB` is not finished in time, it would never be able to executed.
Unlike other actions, as `liquidatePositionsPartyB` has no expiry process, it would simply get blocked after the liquidation timeout has passed.

## Impact

PartyB account could be blocked, remaining liquidated state forever

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Rather than requiring the `priceSig.timestamp` not to be expired compared to the current timestamp, just simply check if the `priceSig` has been created after the liquidation has started
```diff
        require(
-           block.timestamp <= priceSig.timestamp + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
+           maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] <= priceSig.timestamp,
            "LiquidationFacet: Expired price sig"
        );
```
