# Party A liquidation can expire, causing the liquidation to be stuck

## Summary

The liquidation of Party A can expire (i.e., timeout), causing the liquidation to get stuck due to the inability to set symbol prices for Party A's positions.

## Vulnerability Detail

The liquidation of an insolvent Party A necessitates setting the symbol prices for all symbols utilized in Party A's positions. This is accomplished by the liquidator calling the `setSymbolsPrice` function in the `LiquidationFacetImpl` library and supplying the `PriceSig memory priceSig` function parameter. This struct includes the symbol prices and a signature from the Muon app. The signature is used to verify that the symbol prices were actually fetched by the trusted Muon app.

The signature is expected to be created within the liquidation timeout period. Failure to do so results in the signature being treated as expired, thereby causing the function to revert in lines 40-44.

However, if, for any reason, no liquidator calls the `setSymbolsPrice` function within the liquidation timeout, any call after the liquidation timeout will revert due to the expired signature. This essentially means that if the `priceSig` timestamp exceeds `maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout`, the liquidation process is stuck as symbol prices can not be set anymore for this specific Party A liquidation ([symbol prices are expected to be set when calling the `liquidatePositionsPartyA` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L144-L148)).

Moreover, the liquidation status of Party A can not be reset anymore, and currently open positions of Party A [can not be expired](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibQuote.sol#L224-L227) anymore as well. This renders the liquidation of the insolvent Party A stuck and unable to be completed.

## Impact

Party A and its positions can not be liquidated as the liquidation process is stuck. Open positions of Party A remain as-is and can not be expired. Party B will not receive the liquidation proceeds.

47:             priceSig.prices[index],

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding functionality to reset the liquidation status (i.e., `maLayout.liquidationStatus[partyA] = false`, `maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA] = 0` and `accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationType = LiquidationType.NONE`) of Party A once the liquidation timeout is reached.
