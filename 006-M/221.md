# Liquidatable account will be locked

## Summary

Liquidatable account will be locked if it does not move on to the subsequent stage of the liquidation process within a certain timeframe, causing the user's assets to be struck.

## Vulnerability Detail

The liquidation of PartyA consists of four (4) phases:

1. Flagging phase (`liquidatePartyA`):  The liquidator provides a signature and states that this address is insolvent with this uPNL at this timestamp. So the user account will be flagged as liquidatable, and the user account will be frozen.  

2. Setting prices phase (`setSymbolsPrice`): The liquidator gets a signature from Muon and injects a price onto the contract for each symbol.   

3. Canceling pending quotes phase (`liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA`): The pending quotes of the user get canceled.  

4. Close Positions phase (`liquidatePositionsPartyA`): User's positions will be closed with the prices set in Phase 2.

#### Instance 1 - Liquidation of PartyA

Assume that Alice's account can be liquidated. A malicious liquidator called Mallory calls the `liquidatePartyA` function against her account to kickstart the first phase of the liquidation. This marks her account as liquidatable and sets the liquidation's timestamp (`maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA]`) to $x$ in Line 30 below.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L30

```solidity
File: LiquidationFacetImpl.sol
20:     function liquidatePartyA(address partyA, SingleUpnlSig memory upnlSig) internal {
..SNIP..
29:         maLayout.liquidationStatus[partyA] = true;
30:         maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA] = upnlSig.timestamp;
..SNIP..
32:     }
```

Assume that the liquidation timeout (`maLayout.liquidationTimeout`) is 10 minutes. The validation code at Lines 40-43 will evaluate as follows:

> $priceSig.timestamp <= x + 10\ minutes$

Note that $x$ is the liquidation timestamp configured in Phase 1 (`liquidatePartyA`).

With this validation code, the `setSymbolsPrice` function will only accept `priceSig` generated before $x + 10\ minutes$. Any `priceSig` generated after $x + 10\ minutes$ will be rejected, and the transaction will revert.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L40

```solidity
File: LiquidationFacetImpl.sol
34:     function setSymbolsPrice(address partyA, PriceSig memory priceSig) internal {
..SNIP..
38:         LibMuon.verifyPrices(priceSig, partyA);
39:         require(maLayout.liquidationStatus[partyA], "LiquidationFacet: PartyA is solvent");
40:         require(
41:             priceSig.timestamp <=
42:                 maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
43:             "LiquidationFacet: Expired signature"
44:         );
```

The issue is that if the malicious liquidator does not complete Phase 2 (`setSymbolsPrice`) before $x + 10\ minutes$, Alice's account will be locked. 

This is because after $x + 10\ minutes$, the liquidator cannot go back in time to generate a price signature with a timestamp that is smaller than $x + 10\ minutes$. Thus, the price signature submitted to `setSymbolsPrice` will always revert, and there is no way to complete Phase 2 (`setSymbolsPrice`). Since Phase 2 cannot be completed, it is not possible to proceed with the liquidation process. Alice's account will be stuck in the liquidatable state, and her assets cannot be transferred to PartyB (hedger). As a result, this results in a loss of assets for the counterparty.

In addition, there is no guarantee that other liquidators will step in to complete Phase 2 (`setSymbolsPrice`) before $x + 10\ minutes$.

It is also not possible to update the liquidation timestamp by calling the `liquidatePartyA` function again as the `notLiquidatedPartyA` modifier will prevent the call from succeeding. Refer to Line 19 below.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacet.sol#L19

```solidity
File: LiquidationFacet.sol
13:     function liquidatePartyA(
14:         address partyA,
15:         SingleUpnlSig memory upnlSig
16:     )
17:     external
18:     whenNotLiquidationPaused
19:     notLiquidatedPartyA(partyA)
20:     onlyRole(LibAccessibility.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE)
21:     {
22:         LiquidationFacetImpl.liquidatePartyA(partyA, upnlSig);
23:         emit LiquidatePartyA(msg.sender, partyA);
24:     }
```

#### Instance 2 - Liquidation of PartyB

The liquidation process of PartyB is vulnerable to the same issue as a similar design is adopted as shown below.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L273

```solidity
File: LiquidationFacetImpl.sol
240:     function liquidatePartyB(
..SNIP..
272:         maLayout.partyBLiquidationStatus[partyB][partyA] = true;
273:         maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] = upnlSig.timestamp;
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L318

```solidity
File: LiquidationFacetImpl.sol
308:     function liquidatePositionsPartyB(
..SNIP..
317:         LibMuon.verifyQuotePrices(priceSig);
318:         require(
319:             priceSig.timestamp <=
320:                 maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
321:             "LiquidationFacet: Expired signature"
322:         );
```

## Impact

Loss of assets for the counterparty as the transfer of the assets from a liquidatable account to the counterparty cannot be made. The liquidation process cannot be completed as the liquidatable account is stuck. 

In addition, since the liquidatable account is stuck, the assets under the accounts are also locked.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If a liquidator does not complete Phase 2 (`setSymbolsPrice`) before $x + 10\ minutes$, consider allowing other liquidators to call `liquidatePartyA` (Phase 1) again with the latest PnL signature. If the account is insolvent, mark the account as liquidatable and set the liquidation's timestamp to an updated timestamp so that they can proceed with the subsequent liquidation phases. If the account is deemed healthy, mark the account's liquidation status as `false`.
