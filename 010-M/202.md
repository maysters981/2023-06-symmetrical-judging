# When symbol manager modifies the tradingFee of a certain symbol via ControlFacet.setSymbolTradingFee, the value returned by LibQuote.returnTradingFee is not the original fee

## Summary

`LibQuote.receiveTradingFee`/`returnTradingFee` internally use the fee returned by `LibQuote.getTradingFee`Â where relies on `symbol.tradingFee` to calculate the fee. If `symbol.tradingFee` is changed, the new trading fee will be returned to PartyA when a quote created with the old tradingFee is cancelled. **The old and new trading fees are obviously different**. There will be two problems:

- Malicious PartyA will drain the balance of the feeCollector.
- PartyA loses the difference between the old and new trading fee.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's first look at the code of `LibQuotegetTradingFee`:

```solidity
File: symmio-core\contracts\libraries\LibQuote.sol
122:     function getTradingFee(uint256 quoteId) internal view returns (uint256 fee) {
123:         QuoteStorage.Layout storage quoteLayout = QuoteStorage.layout();
124:         Quote storage quote = quoteLayout.quotes[quoteId];
125:->       Symbol storage symbol = SymbolStorage.layout().symbols[quote.symbolId];
126:         if (quote.orderType == OrderType.LIMIT) {
127:             fee =
128:->               (LibQuote.quoteOpenAmount(quote) * quote.requestedOpenPrice * symbol.tradingFee) /
129:                 1e36;
130:         } else {
131:->           fee = (LibQuote.quoteOpenAmount(quote) * quote.marketPrice * symbol.tradingFee) / 1e36;
132:         }
133:     }
```

The calculation of `fee` will change with `symbol.tradingFee`.

There are two situations when the symbol manger modifies the `tradingFee` of a certain symbol.

1.  old tradingFee < new tradingFee
2.  old tradingFee > new tradingFee

Let's look at **the first situation**. For simplicity, I changed formulas [[1](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibQuote.sol#L128)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/[2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibQuote.sol#L131)023-06-symmetrical-securitygrid/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibQuote.sol#L128) and [2](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibQuote.sol#L131) to `fee = value * symbol.tradingFee`, because `value` is equal for `receiveTradingFee` and `returnTradingFee`. **Suppose the trading fee of BTC/USDT is changed from 0.1% to 0.2%**. The malicious PartyA monitors the memory pool and notices this tx. The attack process is as follows (steps 1-2 are in the same block):

1.  PartyA deposits a large amount of collateral, calls `PartyAFacet.sendQuote`, and specifies `partyBsWhiteList` to prevent it from being locked by other PartyB, and the `deadline` is `block.timestamp`. Assuming that the `value` is 1,000,000, then the trading fee PartyA needs to pay is `1,000,000 * 0.1% = 1000`.
2.  The symbol manager calls `ControlFacet.setSymbolTradingFee`.
3.  PartyA calls `PartyAFacet.expireQuote`, because `block.timestamp` is already larger than the set `deadline`. The quote is successfully canceled and the trading fee returned is `1,000,000 * 0.2% = 2000`.

The attacker gets a profit of 1000. In this case, all quotes to cancel will also make a profit.

Now look at **the second situation**. When new `tradingFee` becomes smaller, the normal quote is cancelled, then the fee returned to PartyA is smaller than the original fee. This caused a trading fee loss to PartyA.

## Impact

As mentioned above, when the `tradingFee` of a certain symbol is changed, the impacts will be:

- Protocol suffers trading fee loss. When the `balances[feeCollector]` is drained close to 0, all quotes to cancel will revert due to [[subtraction underflow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibQuote.sol#L139)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibQuote.sol#L139).
- When quote is canceled, PartyA gets less trading fee.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to add a parameter `fee` to the `Quote` structure. Assign fee in `sendQuote`. In this way, the issue caused by the difference between the old and new `tradingFee` can be avoided.
