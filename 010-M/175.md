# Charged trading fee and returned trading fee may be different for a quote

## Summary

Charged trading fee and returned trading fee may be different for a quote.

## Vulnerability Detail

Every time Party A sends a quote, some amount of trading fee is charged. 

If no PartyB opens position for the quote, quote will be expired, and trading fee will be returnded to PartyA.

However, there is no guarantee that the charged trading fee and the returned trading fee are always equal, because trading fee can be changed by **SYMBOL_MANAGER_ROLE**.
```solidity
    function setSymbolTradingFee(
        uint256 symbolId,
        uint256 tradingFee
    ) external onlyRole(LibAccessibility.SYMBOL_MANAGER_ROLE) {
        SymbolStorage.Layout storage symbolLayout = SymbolStorage.layout();
        require(symbolId >= 1 && symbolId <= symbolLayout.lastId, "ControlFacet: Invalid id");
        emit SetSymbolTradingFee(symbolId, symbolLayout.symbols[symbolId].tradingFee, tradingFee);
        symbolLayout.symbols[symbolId].tradingFee = tradingFee;
    }
```
If in any case the trading fee is increased or decreased during the period in which quote is sent and expired, the charged trading fee and returned trading fee will be different.

## Impact

If trading fee is increased, user will receive more trading fee, if trading fee is decreased, user will receive less trading fee.
