# partyA can stuck the funds that partyB used to participate in the quote

## Summary
There is a vulnerability where PartyA can forcefully lock a quote in the system, causing PartyB's funds to be locked until PartyA decides to cancel the quote.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the provided code snippet [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L148-L155), the `requestToClosePosition()` function has a parameter called deadline. By setting this deadline to the current `block.timestamp`, the quote becomes expired in the next block. If partyB tries to call  `fillCloseRequest()` it will revert (code bellow), and there is nothing else partyB can do about the quote state. The quote becomes stuck.
```jsx
 require(block.timestamp <= quote.deadline, "PartyBFacet: Quote is expired");
```
Example scenario:
  - **1** B opens a quote with `openPosition()`, and immediately after that A calls `requestToClosePosition()` with 
`deadline == block.timestamp`
- **2** When B attempts to call `fillCloseRequest()`, it consistently reverts with `require(block.timestamp <= quote.deadline)`.

The quote remains stuck until A decides to call `requestToCancelCloseRequest()` or until someone calls `forceCancelCloseRequest()`, which takes some time, because `forceCancelCloseRequest()` has a cool-down of:
```jsx
        maLayout.forceCancelCooldown = 3000000000000000;
```
Even if this time is shortened, PartyA has managed to lock funds in the contract, preventing PartyB from using them.
## Impact
PartyB funds will be stuck in the system.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a `minDeadline` amount [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L160-L165):
```jsx
        require(quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.OPENED, "PartyAFacet: Invalid state");
        require(deadline >= block.timestamp, "PartyAFacet: Low deadline");
+       require(deadline >= minDeadline, "PartyAFacet: Low deadline");
```
