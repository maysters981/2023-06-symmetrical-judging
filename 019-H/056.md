# Liquidators can front-run the system or other liquidations to receive 100% of the profit with small amounts of gas paid

## Summary
Liquidators can front-run other liquidators or the system (when liquidating users with too small debts to be profitable), for small amounts of gas gaining 100% of the profits from liquidation and paying small amounts of gas, thus leaving 0% of the profits for the front-runned liquidator who pays the large gas cost. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Since the system works by using 4 liquidate function that should be called after each other a liquidator seeking bigger profits can actually pay small amounts of gas calling the first 2, and leave the heavy gas consuming latter 2 for the other liquidator, and because the rewards are calculated within the first 2 function the fist liquidator gains 100% of the rewards, while the second one does not make any money in return.

**Example:**

 - **LiquidatorA:** tries to call the 4 functions in a row (to liquidate partyA)  [`liquidatePartyA()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L20-L32) => [`setSymbolsPrice()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L34-L97) => [`liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L99-L124) => [`liquidatePositionsPartyA()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L126-L238)

 - **LiquidatorB:** front-runs only the first 2 functions `liquidatePartyA()` and `setSymbolsPrice()` and since the liquidator's profit is calculated only in these functions he will receive 100% of money from liquidation.

In [`liquidatePartyA()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L20-L32)
```jsx
AccountStorage.layout().liquidators[partyA].push(msg.sender);
```
Also in [`setSymbolsPrice()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L34-L97)
```jsx
AccountStorage.layout().liquidators[partyA].push(msg.sender);
```
And finally the [`liquidatePositionsPartyA()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L126-L238) sends the fees, but since bolt `[accountLayout.liquidators[partyA][0]` and `[accountLayout.liquidators[partyA][1]` is **liquidatorB** he gets the profits.
```jsx
            uint256 lf = accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationFee;
            if (lf > 0) {
                accountLayout.allocatedBalances[accountLayout.liquidators[partyA][0]] += lf / 2;
                accountLayout.allocatedBalances[accountLayout.liquidators[partyA][1]] += lf / 2;
            }
```
`liquidatePartyA()` and `setSymbolsPrice()` quite cheap on gas, they are just setters of variable and don't do many calculations. On the other hand `liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA()` `liquidatePositionsPartyA()` are quite heavy in gas since they iterate (with a `for()` loop) over pending or locked quotes of users.

Another profitable scenario is when the system liquidates players with small positions, because it is not profitable for normal liquidators to liquidate them. Instead smart liquidators can front-run the system with `liquidatePartyA()` and `setSymbolsPrice()` and leave the system to pay the high gas cost,
## Impact
Liquidators gaming the system or other liquidators.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I find it quite difficult to recommend a simple solution to this issue. Best this I can suggest is to make a single function that combines the 4 and use that, or make the calculation of  rewards in the latter 2, because they re more gas heavy.
