# Liquidator can be frontrunned on step2 to receive liquidation fee and spend less gas

## Summary
Liquidator can be frontrunned on step2 to receive liquidation fee and spend less gas
## Vulnerability Detail
In step2 of partyA liquidation, liquidator [should provide prices](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L34-L97). In case if prices are provided [for first time](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L56), he [will be stored as second fee receiver](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L88.

You still can call this function for the next time if you want to provide additional prices. In this case, you will [not be stored to fee receivers array](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L89-L96).

In order to spend less amount of gas one liquidator can frontrun another with call, where he will provide less amount of prices that user uses and will be stored as fee receiver. Right after that call, original liquidator will update all needed prices. however he will not be stored as fee receiver.
## Impact
Honest liquidator can be frontruned and will not receive fees.
