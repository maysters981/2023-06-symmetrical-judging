# Liquidator can get liquidation fee two times for the same quote

## Summary
Liquidation logic may be broken when partyA and partyB are simultaneously liquidatable, resulting in both sides paying fees on the same quote

## Vulnerability Detail
When partyA and partyB are liquidatable, there are some protections preventing from liquidating quotes two times

However there is a legitimate scenario in which partyB and partyA can be liquidated in such a way that liquidation fee is drawn from both of the accounts.

Here are the steps for the scenario:

### context:
partyB Bob is liquidatable with regards to partyA Alice
partyA Alice is liquidatable with regards to all of her positions with various partyB's (Carols)

- A liquidator can first initiate partyB liquidation by calling `LiquidationFacet.liquidatePartyB`

- Then liquidator calls `LiquidationFacet.liquidatePartyA` and `LiquidationFacet.setSymbolsPrice`
This will compute liquidation fees for Alice with `quotes`, `lockedBalances` and `UPNLs` pre Bob's liquidation:

- Then liquidator calls `LiquidationFacet.liquidatePositionsPartyB` with all quotes opened between Alice and Bob, getting max liquidation fee

- Liquidator finally calls `LiquidationFacet.liquidatePositionsPartyA` with all quotes except the ones already consumed during Bob's liquidation and gets liquidation fee computed during `setSymbolsPrice`

## Impact
Liquidator gets double the liquidation fee for a unique quote which should not happen

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Maybe add modifier `notLiquidatedPartyA` on `liquidatePositionsPartyB`
