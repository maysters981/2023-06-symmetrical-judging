# Liquidator can receive both portions of the lf

## Summary
A single liquidator could potentially exploit the liquidation process by calling the 'liquidatePartyA' function twice in succession, thereby assuming both the initiator and price-setter roles typically performed by separate liquidators.
## Vulnerability Detail
Typically, the liquidation process requires two distinct liquidators: the first one initiates the liquidation process by calling the 'liquidatePartyA' function, and the second one sets the price using the 'setSymbolsPrice' function. However, a scenario could occur where one liquidator executes the 'liquidatePartyA' function twice consecutively. This results in the same liquidator occupying both the first and second positions in the array of liquidators for partyA.

## Impact
This would deincentivise the liquidator community since whoever calls the liquidatePartyA twice secures the fee regardless of who does the rest of the liquidation
