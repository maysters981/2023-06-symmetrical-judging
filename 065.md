# Liquidator can make partyA unliquidatable by double calling liquidatePartyA

## Summary
A liquidator can call liquidatePartyA multiple times, causing a discrepancy in timestamps. This discrepancy makes subsequent liquidation steps fail due to the require checks. Furthermore, resetting the price to proceed with the liquidation might lead to reversion, as the conditions within the setSymbolsPrice function are challenging to satisfy due to constant price updates. This could effectively disrupt the liquidation process.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the process of liquidating a vulnerable PartyA, a four-step procedure is initiated. First, the liquidator, let's call him Bob, calls liquidatePartyA, updating specific variables associated with PartyA, named Alice, in maLayout. Then, Bob sets the price via the setSymbolsPrice function. However, instead of proceeding to the liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA function, Bob takes an unexpected action.

Bob decides to call liquidatePartyA for a second time after a few blocks have passed, thus modifying the timestamp again. When another liquidator then attempts to execute liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA and liquidatePositionsPartyA, the process reverts due to a discrepancy in timestamps. This mismatch occurs as a result of the following validation in the liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA function:

```solidity
require(
                accountLayout.symbolsPrices[partyA][quote.symbolId].timestamp ==
                    maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA],
                "LiquidationFacet: Price should be set"
            );
```

To bypass this issue and proceed with liquidation, the price must be set again, which is challenging because the liquidators cannot alter maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA] to a prior block.timestamp. However, calling setSymbolsPrice a second time may lead to another reversion due to the following condition within the function:

```solidity
require(
                accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].upnl == priceSig.upnl &&
                    accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].totalUnrealizedLoss ==
                    priceSig.totalUnrealizedLoss,
                "LiquidationFacet: Invalid upnl sig"
            );
```

Since the liquidationType is not set to 'NONE', this else condition is executed. Given that the prices are updated every 1-10 sec, it's highly likely that the new priceSig.upnl and priceSig.totalUnrealizedLoss are different from the previously stored balances when Bob first initiated the function. This divergence makes it challenging to satisfy the exact same upnl and totalUnrealizedLoss for the liquidation to go through, considering the price fluctuations occur frequently.
## Impact
I sent multiple requests to this endpoint in the doc "https://fapi.binance.com/fapi/v1/premiumIndex" and saw that the prices are updated almost every second, which means that it is very unlikely to have the same price for a symbol for a second time.
