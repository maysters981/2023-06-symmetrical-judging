# Quote that have already been liquidated can be liquidated again in some cases

## Summary

`LiquidationFacetImpl.liquidatePartyB` is used to liquidate PartyB, which directly adds `partyBAllocatedBalances[partyB][partyA]` to `allocatedBalances[partyA]` [[here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L294-L296)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L294-L296). In this way, the liquidation against PartyB has been completed. The main purpose of `LiquidationFacetImpl.liquidatePositionsPartyB` is to remove the [[OpenPositions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L369)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L369) of both parties. **If this function is not called, the OpenPosition of both parties will always exist**.

Afterwards, if PartyA is liquidated due to quote with other PartyB, `LiquidationFacetImpl.liquidatePositionsPartyA` will process the quotes with the original PartyB. These quotes should have been removed.

## Vulnerability Detail

**For simplicity, the numbers mentioned below will not be exact values, it is just to describe the issue**. Suppose the following scenario:

There are 3 users: PartyA(A1), PartyB(B1), PartyB(B2). The symbol is ETH/USDT.

allocatedBalances[A1]=1000

partyBAllocatedBalances[B1][A1]=1000

partyBAllocatedBalances[B2][A1]=1000

1.  A1 created a short quote1 via `PartyAFacet.sendQuote`. pendingLockedBalances[A1]=500. The current symbol price is 100.
2.  B1 opens quote1 via `PartyBFacet.lockAndOpenQuote`. lockedBalances[A1]=500, partyBLockedBalances[B1][A1]=500. [[LibQuote.addToOpenPositions](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L253)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L253) will add quote1 to the OpenPositions array of both parties. The status of quote1 is `QuoteStatus.OPENED`.
3.  As time goes by, the price dumps to 50. B1 can be liquidated.
4.  The liquidator initiates liquidation against B1 via `LiquidationFacet.liquidatePartyB`. allocatedBalances[A1]=1000+partyBAllocatedBalances[B1][A1]=2000, partyBAllocatedBalances[B1][A1]=0.
5.  `liquidatePositionsPartyB` is not called, so the OpenPositions array of both parties still contains quote1, and its status is still `QuoteStatus.OPENED`.
6.  A1 thinks that the price will continue to dump, and creates a short quote2. pendingLockedBalances[A1]=500. The current price is 50. Because allocatedBalances[A1]=2000 at this time, when the price pump to 200, A1 will be liquidated.
7.  B2 opens quote2. lockedBalances[A1]=500, partyBLockedBalances[B2][A1]=500. The OpenPositions array of A1 contains quote1 and quote2. The OpenPositions array of B2 only has quote2.
8.  As time goes by, the price pumps to 200. A1 can be liquidated.
9.  The liquidator initiates liquidation of A1. This process requires 3 calls: `LiquidationFacet.liquidatePartyA`/`setSymbolsPrice`/`liquidatePositionsPartyA`. The [[priceSig](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacet.sol#L28)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacet.sol#L28) of `setSymbolsPrice` is calculated off-chain. From the flow of the [[uPnlPartyA](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/muon/crypto_v3.js#L238-L267)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/muon/crypto_v3.js#L238-L267) function in crypto_v3.js, all quotes in the OpenPositions array of A1 will be calculated into upnl. Because quote1 was opened when the price was 100, and the current price is 200, so B1 is profitable. This means that B1 that has been liquidated can also be allocated part of allocatedBalances[A1]. This is obviously unreasonable. This is a loss of part of the funds for B2.

## Impact

Quotes that have already been liquidated can be liquidated again in some cases.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Two ways to fix:

- agrees with that [[the commented code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L350-L360)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L350-L360) in `liquidPositionsPartyB`.
- The logic of `liquidatePartyB` and `liquidatePositionsPartyB` should be merged. But this maybe trigger OOG because the OpenPosition array is large.
