# Malicious liquidator can get the liquidation fee without finalizing the full liquidation of Party A.

## Summary
Malicious liquidator can get the liquidation fee without finalizing the full liquidation of Party A.

## Vulnerability Detail
If we look at the sherlock contest page, it is clearly stated that every role is trusted except the liquidator role.

On the current protocol design, it is possible that a malicious liquidator can receive the liquidation fee without actually finishing the full liquidation of Party A.

The path for successfully liquidating Party A is:

liquidatePartyA -> setSymbolPrices -> liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA -> liquidatePositionsPartyA

The liquidation fee is paid to the addresses from the array liquidatorsPartyA[] in the final function liquidatePositionsPartyA, when all the positions are liquidated.

But in order to get into this array, a liquidator will need to call only one of the functions liquidatePartyA or setSymbolPrices.
Therefore there is no actual need to do the full process of liquidation in order to get the liquidation fee.

Given this scenario liquidators will be tempted to do only half of the liquidation process, as they will still receive the full liquidation fee at the end when someone else finishes the liquidation process.

## Impact
Malicious liquidators can receive the liquidation fee without finishing the full liquidation of Party A.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Given the issue describe above, it should be a better approach to give the liquidation fee at the msg.sender which liquidated all of the positions in the function liquidatePositionsPartyA. This way the liquidator will be more motivated to liquidate all of the positions and receive the whole liquidation reward than only doing half of the liquidation process.
