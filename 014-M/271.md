# Validity of `symbolId` is not checked when creating new quote in the `openPosition` function.

## Summary
The `PartyBFacet.openPosition` creates a new quote (in case of partial fill) but does not validate the `isValid` status of `symbolId`.

## Vulnerability Detail
In Symmetrical protocol new quotes are created at two places, first in `PartyAFacetImpl.sendQuote` and second in `PartyBFacetImpl.openPosition` (in case of partial fill).

In `sendQuote` the `isValid` status of `symbolId` is validated but the same is not done in `openPosition`. This can result in new quotes getting created for a `symbolId` which has been marked as invalid by the admin.

The admin can change the `isValid` status of a `symbolId` using `ControlFacet.setSymbolValidationState` function.

## Impact
Scenario:
1. PartyA creates a quote for symbolId 1.
2. PartyB locks the quote.
3. The `SYMBOL_MANAGER_ROLE` calls `setSymbolValidationState` function and set `isValid` to false for symbolId 1.
4. PartyB partially fills the original position. So a new quote is created with the remaining amounts.
5. Even though the symbolId is not valid anymore, a new quote was created which can be locked/opened by partyB.

Note that oracle failure for a specific symbolId is a likely scenario for invalidating a symbolId, so creating new quotes for that invalid oracle/symbolId bears significant risk.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider validating the isValid status of symbolId when creating new quote in `openPosition` function and if the status is invalid then cancel the position. It is upto protocol team's discretion to decide whether to cancel the entire quote or just the remaining quote.
