# partyA can always queue a closeRequest so he/she could cancel it through expire to front-run partyB when seeing a less favourable price

## Summary
partyA can always queue a closeRequest so he/she could cancel it through expire to front-run partyB when seeing a less favourable price

## Vulnerability Detail
when partyA requestToCancelCloseRequest, it needs to enter CANCEL_CLOSE_PENDING, unless the order has already passed the deadline. However, since partyA could always queue a fillRequest (like a limit order), he could always short-circuit to the expireQuote path instead of entering CANCEL_CLOSE_PENDING. 

For example,
1. partyA has an open position of ETH price at $1000 with partyB
2. partyA pre-send a limit ask at $1050 (fillRequest)
3. After sometime, concretely when `block.timestamp > quote.deadline`, ETH price shoot to $1050; partyB send a CloseRequest to mempool; 
4. Now partyA witness the price at next oracles/some other sources that ETH is at $1055, so instead he could frontrun the tx from partyB with a requestToCancelCloseRequest, since his/her fillRequest has already expired, the order enters the expireQuote path.
5. Otherwise partyA could also let the fillRequest gets filled if he/she peels into a worse price at oracle.

```solidity
    function requestToCancelCloseRequest(uint256 quoteId) internal returns (QuoteStatus) {
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        Quote storage quote = QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId];

        require(quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.CLOSE_PENDING, "PartyAFacet: Invalid state");
        if (block.timestamp > quote.deadline) {
            LibQuote.expireQuote(quoteId);
            return QuoteStatus.OPENED;
        } else {
....
```

## Impact
partyA can front-run partyB in fillCloseRequest by always queuing a fillRequest that has expired.
