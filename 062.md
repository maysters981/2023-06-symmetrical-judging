# PartyA can grief the liquidators

## Summary
When a user anticipates liquidation, they can front-run the liquidator's transaction by incrementing their nonce, causing the liquidator's transaction to fail due to the incorrect nonce. As the liquidator initiates the liquidatePartyA function with the user's nonce retrieved off-chain, the user can outpace the transaction by invoking a cheap allocate function that increments their on-chain nonce. This method can lead to liquidators possibly skipping users who repeatedly cause their transactions to fail, thereby avoiding unnecessary costs from reverted transactions.
## Vulnerability Detail
In liquidation process, the liquidator initiates a call to liquidatePartyA as the first step. An input parameter of this function is SingleUpnlSig, which is validated inside the LibMuon library.

When calculating the off-chain upln signature via the Muon app, the partyA's nonce is retrieved as shown in this JavaScript snippet:

```javascript
uPnlPartyA: async function (partyA, chainId, v3Contract) {
    // Fetches the open positions and quote IDs for partyA
    const { openPositions, quoteIds, symbolIds } = await this.fetchOpenPositions({ partyA }, 'A', chainId, v3Contract);

    // Retrieves the nonce of partyA
    const nonce = await ethCall(v3Contract, 'nonceOfPartyA', [partyA], ABI, chainId);

    // If there are no open positions, return the result with zero uPnl, notional value sum,
    // nonce, quote IDs, open positions, prices map and mark prices (retrieved using the getPrices function)
    if (openPositions.length == 0) {
        const { pricesMap, markPrices } = await this.getPrices([]);
        return {
            uPnl: ZERO.toString(),
            loss: ZERO.toString(),
            notionalValueSum: ZERO.toString(),
            nonce,
            quoteIds,
            symbolIds: [],
            prices: [],
            openPositions,
            pricesMap,
            markPrices
        };
    }

    // Fetches the prices, prices map and mark prices for the quote IDs
    const { symbols, prices, pricesMap, markPrices } = await this.fetchPrices(quoteIds, chainId, v3Contract);

    // Calculates the uPnl and notional value sum using the open positions and prices
    const { uPnl, loss, notionalValueSum } = await this.calculateUpnl(openPositions, prices);

    // Returns the result with the calculated uPnl, notional value sum, nonce, prices map,
    // prices, quote IDs, open positions and mark prices
    return {
        uPnl: uPnl.toString(),
        loss: loss.toString(),
        notionalValueSum: notionalValueSum.toString(),
        nonce,
        pricesMap,
        symbolIds,
        symbols,
        prices,
        quoteIds,
        openPositions,
        markPrices
    };
},
```

And here how the signature is verified onchain:
```solidity
function verifyPartyAUpnl(SingleUpnlSig memory upnlSig, address partyA) internal view {
        MuonStorage.Layout storage muonLayout = MuonStorage.layout();
        //        require(
        //            block.timestamp <= upnlSig.timestamp + muonLayout.upnlValidTime,
        //            "LibMuon: Expired signature"
        //        );
        bytes32 hash = keccak256(
            abi.encodePacked(
                muonLayout.muonAppId,
                upnlSig.reqId,
                address(this),
                partyA,
                AccountStorage.layout().partyANonces[partyA],
                upnlSig.upnl,
                upnlSig.timestamp,
                getChainId()
            )
        );
        verifyTSSAndGateway(hash, upnlSig.sigs, upnlSig.gatewaySignature);
    }
```
The off-chain calculation fetches the nonce directly from the contract, and the on-chain validation uses this current nonce for partyA. Thus, if a user, say Alice, realizes she is eligible for liquidation, she can outpace the liquidator transaction and increment her nonce. By doing so, the liquidator's transaction persistently fails due to the incorrect nonce.

To illustrate this, consider the allocate function:

```solidity
function allocate(uint256 amount) internal {
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        require(
            accountLayout.allocatedBalances[msg.sender] + amount <=
            GlobalAppStorage.layout().balanceLimitPerUser,
            "AccountFacet: Allocated balance limit reached"
        );
        require(accountLayout.balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "AccountFacet: Insufficient balance");
        accountLayout.partyANonces[msg.sender] += 1;
        accountLayout.balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
        accountLayout.allocatedBalances[msg.sender] += amount;
    }
```
The allocate function is concise and economical, and can be invoked with a meager amount (1 wei), making it virtually free.

Suppose Alice, a partyA user, is subject to liquidation, and her current nonce is 3. A liquidator, upon identifying Alice's liquidation eligibility, invokes liquidatePartyA with an off-chain upnl signature linked to nonce 3. If Alice notices that she is susceptible to liquidation, she might monitor the mempool for liquidatePartyA calls. Upon detecting such a transaction, Alice swiftly calls allocate with 1 wei to increment her nonce, causing the liquidator's transaction to fail because the on-chain nonce has now escalated to 4 while the Muon app signature was generated off-chain for nonce 3. By repeating this front-running strategy, Alice could potentially deter liquidators, who may decide to skip Alice to avoid footing the bill for reverted transactions.
