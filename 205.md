# Missing onlyPartyB modifier in the transferAllocation function in AccountFacetImpl.sol

## Summary

The transferAllocation function should only be able to be called by a PartyB and not a PartyA or anyone else for that matter as this could lead to unexpected behaviour.

## Vulnerability Detail

A bad actor could create an attack contract in order to trick a PartyB into calling it and through that contract calling transferAllocation in order to move funds from one partyB <> partyA pair to another partyB <> partyA pair. 

## Impact

This can lead to funds being moved to places and to different accounts where they shouldn't be.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the 'onlyPartyB' modifier to the function transferAllocation function.
