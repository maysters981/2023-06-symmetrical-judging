# partyB liquidation doesn't return trading fee back to partyA

## Summary
Although the trading fee is refunded when a position is cancelled under normal circumstances, it's not returned when the cancellation is due to PartyB's liquidation. This is a concern because PartyA should not be penalized for PartyB's financial circumstances
## Vulnerability Detail
When a pending position is cancelled in various scenarios throughout the code, the trading fee paid by PartyA is always refunded. However, a discrepancy arises when PartyB becomes liquidated. In this situation, while the pending positions of PartyA are returned, the trading fee is not. This raises an issue as PartyA should not bear the consequences of PartyB's liquidation. Therefore, in line with the rest of the code logic, PartyA should receive a refund of the trading fee.
