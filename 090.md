# balanceLimitPerUser can be bypassed

## Summary
`balanceLimitPerUser` can be bypassed
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `allocate` function, it is required that `allocatedBalances` cannot be greater than `balanceLimitPerUser`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L41-L47
```solidity
    function allocate(uint256 amount) internal {
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        require(
            accountLayout.allocatedBalances[msg.sender] + amount <=
            GlobalAppStorage.layout().balanceLimitPerUser,
            "AccountFacet: Allocated balance limit reached"
        );
```

But in other places where `allocateBalance` is increased, there is no check on `balanceLimitPerUser`. For example, in `liquidatePartyB`, the increase is directly applied to `accountLayout.allocatedBalances[msg.sender]`, without any additional requirements for msg.sender's `allocateBalance`.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L303-L305
```solidity
        if (liquidatorShare > 0) {
            accountLayout.allocatedBalances[msg.sender] += liquidatorShare;
        }
```

This has compromised the integrity of `balanceLimitPerUser` functionality.

## Recommendation
Check at every point where `allocatedBalances` are increased if `balanceLimitPerUser` is satisfied.
