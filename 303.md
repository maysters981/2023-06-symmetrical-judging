# Missing modifier `onlyPartyB` on `AccountFaucer.transferAllocation`

## Summary
The modifier `onlyPartyB` is not used on function `AccountFaucer.transferAllocation` 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `transferAllocation` function which is meant for PartyB to transfer their allocated amount, can be called by any user.

## Impact
Not sure if would cause loss of funds in any way, but looks like something that the developer missed to do.

*Though in case the function is expected to be used by PartyA , then it clearly misses the following check in `AccountFacetImpl.transferAllocation`:

```solidity
require(
  !MAStorage.layout().liquidationStatus[quote.partyA],
  "LibQuote: PartyA isn't solvent"
);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the function code to:
```solidity
function transferAllocation(
        uint256 amount,
        address origin,
        address recipient,
        SingleUpnlSig memory upnlSig
    ) external whenNotPartyBActionsPaused onlyPartyB {
```
