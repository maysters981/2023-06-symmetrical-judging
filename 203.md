# Malicious PartyA/PartyB can prevent themselves from being liquidated

## Summary

Since the protocol is deployed on multiple chains, the tx on some chains is easy to be front-run. When liquidating PartyA, `LibMuon.verifyPartyAUpnl(upnlSig, partyA)` will be called to verify the parameter `upnlSig` from off-chain. This function internally uses the current `partyANonces[partyA]` to calculate the hash to verify the `upnlSig`. **When this `upnlSig` is generated from off-chain, the `partyANonces[partyA]` used is obtained via [[nonceOfPartyA](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/ViewFacet.sol#L127-L129)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/ViewFacet.sol#L127-L129) at that time**. In most cases, `partyANonces[partyA]` at these two moments are equal. However, a malicious PartyA can monitor the mempool and front-run `LiquidationFacet.liquidatePartyA` to make current `partyANonces[partyA]` different from the `partyANonces[partyA]` used when generating `upnlSig`, causing `verifyPartyAUpnl` to fail to verify `upnlSig`. **In this way, the `liquidatePartyA` tx will revert**. PartyB can also use a similar method to avoid being liquidated.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a liquidator notices that PartyA can be liquidated, he will initiate liquidation against PartyA via `LiquidationFacet.liquidatePartyA`. The flow of this function is as follows:

```flow
LiquidationFacet.liquidatePartyA(partyA, upnlSig)
  LiquidationFacetImpl.liquidatePartyA(partyA, upnlSig)
    LibMuon.verifyPartyAUpnl(upnlSig, partyA)
    ...
  ...
```

Let's look at the code snippet of `LibMuon.verifyPartyAUpnl`:

```solidity
File: symmio-core\contracts\libraries\LibMuon.sol
093:         bytes32 hash = keccak256(
094:             abi.encodePacked(
095:                 muonLayout.muonAppId,
096:                 upnlSig.reqId,
097:                 address(this),
098:                 partyA,
099:->               AccountStorage.layout().partyANonces[partyA],//this value can be changed.
100:                 upnlSig.upnl,
101:                 upnlSig.timestamp,
102:                 getChainId()
103:             )
104:         );
105:->       verifyTSSAndGateway(hash, upnlSig.sigs, upnlSig.gatewaySignature); //revert inside it due to wrong hash
```

Suppose the following scenario:

bob is PartyA, `accountLayout.balances[bob]=1e18`, `accountLayout.allocatedBalances[bob]=1000018`.

1.  bob creates a quote via `PartyAFacet.sendQuote`.
2.  As PartyB, alice locks the quote and opens the position.
3.  As time goes by, bob can be liquidated.
4.  As the liquidator, tom initiates liquidation against bob via `LiquidationFacet.liquidatePartyA`. This tx enters the mempool. Suppose `partyANonces[bob]` used when generating `upnlSig` is 10.
5.  Bob's robot monitors this tx, and immediately initiates `AccountFacet.allocate(1)` to front-run it. At this time, `partyANonces[bob]` is increased by 1, equal to 11.
6.  `LiquidationFacet.liquidatePartyA` will revert due to failure to verify `upnlSig`.

Why does `AccountFacet.allocate(1)` increase `partyANonces[bob]` by 1? Let's look at the code of this function:

```solidity
File: symmio-core\contracts\facets\Account\AccountFacetImpl.sol
41:     function allocate(uint256 amount) internal {
......
49:->       accountLayout.partyANonces[msg.sender] += 1;
50:         accountLayout.balances[msg.sender] -= amount;
51:         accountLayout.allocatedBalances[msg.sender] += amount;
52:     }
```

As mentioned above, **a malicious PartyA can always prevent itself from being liquidated in this way. Until the price of the symbol moves towards a profitable direction, PartyA finally makes a profit**.

Similarly, a malicious PartyB can do the same. The flow of `LiquidationFacet.liquidatePartyB` is as follows:

```flow
LiquidationFacet.liquidatePartyB(partyB, partyA, upnlSig)
  LiquidationFacetImpl.liquidatePartyB(partyB, partyA, upnlSig)
    LibMuon.verifyPartyBUpnl(upnlSig, partyB, partyA)
    ...
  ...
```

A similar explanation for PartyB will no longer be made here. The relevant functions are as follows:

## Impact

As mentioned above, malicious PartyA or PartyB can make profits in the following situations:

1.  When the price moves in profitable direction, he can close the position to realize a profit.
2.  When the price moves in the direction of loss, they can prevent liquidation until the price moves in the opposite direction. ultimately achieve profitability.

## Recommendation

This issue does not appear to be easy to fix. A simple and effective suggestion is to set a minimum allocation amount to increase the attack cost.
