# Any user can avoid paying most of the protocol fees on short positions, and can unknowingly pay very high fee on long positions

## Summary

Protocol fee paid by the user for LIMIT orders is calculated based on the LIMIT `price` provided by the user. For short positions, a very low LIMIT `price` allows to basically open short position close to MARKET order (using current market price). However, the fee paid will be based on very low LIMIT `price`, which is far below current market price, allowing the user to pay very low fee (close to 0), which is the funds lost by the protocol (the user steals his fee from the protocol).

For long positions, if the LIMIT `price` provided is very high (which basically equals a MARKET long order), the user will unknowningly overpay the fee due to the same bug.

## Vulnerability Detail

For LIMIT orders, the protocol fee user pays is calculated as percentage of `quantity * requestedOpenPrice`, which is a price provided by the user in the quote.

For short positions, a user can provide very low price (for example, if current ETH price is $1000, user can provide $1) and be charged a very low fee ($0.01 instead of $10). Since the provided price is very low, the order will basically be equal to MARKET order. This allows users to avoid paying the protocol fee, which is a loss of fees funds for the protocol.

For long positions, if a user uses a high limit price (which basically equals long MARKET order), he will unknowingly pay very large fee (for example, if current ETH price is $1000, user provides a $10000 LIMIT price, paying $100 fee instead of $10). This is a loss of funds for the user, which he didn't expect to pay.

## Impact

For short positions, users can avoid paying protocol fees for opened positions, resulting in protocol fee loss.

For long positions, users can pay very large fee, resulting in user funds loss.

## Code Snippet

Add this to any test, for example to `ClosePosition.behavior.ts`

```ts
  it("1. Paying very low fees", async function () {
    const context: RunContext = this.context;

    this.user_allocated = decimal(500);
    this.hedger_allocated = decimal(4000);

    this.user = new User(this.context, this.context.signers.user);
    await this.user.setup();
    await this.user.setBalances(this.user_allocated, this.user_allocated, this.user_allocated);

    this.hedger = new Hedger(this.context, this.context.signers.hedger);
    await this.hedger.setup();
    await this.hedger.setBalances(this.hedger_allocated, this.hedger_allocated);

    // Quote1 SHORT opened
    await this.user.sendQuote(limitQuoteRequestBuilder().positionType(PositionType.SHORT).quantity(decimal(500)).build());
    await this.hedger.lockQuote(1);
    await this.hedger.openPosition(1, limitOpenRequestBuilder().filledAmount(decimal(500)).build());

    var feeCollectorAddress = await context.viewFacet.getFeeCollector();
    var feeBalance = await context.viewFacet.balanceOf(feeCollectorAddress);

    console.log("Fee collected (LIMIT SHORT 500 @ 1.0, filled at 1.0): " + feeBalance/1e18);

    // Quote2 SHORT opened
    await this.user.sendQuote(limitQuoteRequestBuilder().positionType(PositionType.SHORT).quantity(decimal(500)).price(decimal(2, 17)).build());
    await this.hedger.lockQuote(2);
    await this.hedger.openPosition(2, limitOpenRequestBuilder().filledAmount(decimal(500)).build());

    feeBalance = await context.viewFacet.balanceOf(feeCollectorAddress) - feeBalance;

    console.log("Fee collected (LIMIT SHORT 500 @ 0.2, filled at 1.0): " + feeBalance/1e18);

  });
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There are a couple of options depending on team preference:

1. Always calculate fee based on market price (`quote.marketPrice`), both for MARKET and LIMIT orders. Upside is very easy fix, downside is that for LIMIT orders which are on the market for a long time (aiming for prices away from current market), the fees will be wrong (the market price at openPosition time can be very different from the price at the sendQuote time).

2. The fee should be taken based on actual position openPrice (at the time of opening the position), rather than any price at the sendQuote time. Upside is completely correct fees in any conditions, downside is more difficult fix (and slight differences from the preliminary fees paid at sendQuote time). It will require returning the fees before opening a position, and taking it again (but based on openPrice) after the position is opened.
