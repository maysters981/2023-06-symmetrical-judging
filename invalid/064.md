# Loss of funds duo to wrong accounting of decimals when changing collateral.

## Summary
Changing the collateral leads to the wrong accounting of the existing balances duo to decimals difference between USDC and USDT. 

## Vulnerability Detail

On the sherlock contest page, it is shown the symmetrical protocol can interact with both USDC and USDT tokens. Which has different decimals on the most chains: USDC - 18 decimals, USDT - 6 decimals.

By looking at the protocol design, the amount which is added to the users balances is calculated in 18 decimals, so everything will work fine and the decimals of the tokens won't matter here.

The problem occurs when the protocol team wants to change the collateral between USDC or USDT.
This will lead to the wrong accounting of the existing balances, as they will no longer be calculated based on the old decimals but the new ones.

## Impact
Wrong accounting of the existing balances duo to decimal difference.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
As how it is right now, the protocol design doesn't allow changing the collateral when there are existing balances.
The code should be changed or the function setCollateral should be removed.
