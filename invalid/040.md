# timely liquidation leads to a reduced partyA refund amount of allocatedBalance

## Summary
timely liquidation of PartyB leads to a reduced partyA refund amount of allocatedBalance; while a slower liquidation of PartyB leads to a full refund.

## Vulnerability Detail
When PartyB gets liquidated, partyA would get back the previously allocated balance, minus and remainingLf (liquidation fee). 
However, when availableBalance is even more negative than the liquidation fee, remainingLiquidationFee would be 0. 

This is problematic, since a timely liquidation would reduce more from the lockedBalance of PartyA (when remainingLf is bigger), while a slower liquidation(when remainingLf is 0) would lead to PartyA getting the whole previously locked amount.

```solidity
        uint256 remainingLf;
        if (uint256(-availableBalance) < accountLayout.partyBLockedBalances[partyB][partyA].lf) {
            remainingLf =
                accountLayout.partyBLockedBalances[partyB][partyA].lf -
                uint256(-availableBalance);
            liquidatorShare = (remainingLf * maLayout.liquidatorShare) / 1e18;

            maLayout.partyBPositionLiquidatorsShare[partyB][partyA] =
                (remainingLf - liquidatorShare) /
                quoteLayout.partyBPositionsCount[partyB][partyA];
        } else {
            maLayout.partyBPositionLiquidatorsShare[partyB][partyA] = 0;
        }
```

Party gets back the lockedAmount, minus any remainingLf.
```solidity
        accountLayout.allocatedBalances[partyA] +=
            accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[partyB][partyA] -
            remainingLf;
```

## Impact
slower liquidation leads to full refund of allocatedBalance for partyA; but timely liquidation leads to a smaller refund for partyA.

## Recommendation
Consider accounting the `liquidation fee` from PartyB instead of PartyA.
```solidity
accountLayout.allocatedBalances[partyA] +=
            accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[partyB][partyA];
accountLayout.Balances[partyB] -= remainingLf;
```
