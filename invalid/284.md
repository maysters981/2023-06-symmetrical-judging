# Unlocked Solidity version incompatible with all EVM chains listed

## Summary
Different EVM compatible chains were listed in the project summary, however Due to compatibility issue, this contracts would produce unexpected results in these chains. 
Some of these chains like Arbitrum and Optimism do not fully support ```solidity 0.8.20``` 
## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
pragma solidity >=0.8.18;
//@audit-issue restrict pragma to version because of unsupported opcodes

```
Using ```pragma solidity >=0.8.18 ``` allows the solc to use any compiler equal to or later than ```0.8.18``` 
## Impact
All contracts, libraries and interfaces in the codebase should be updated

## Recommendation
