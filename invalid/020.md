# Pragma set to `>=0.8.18`, but Arbitrum doesn't  work with `0.8.20` and newer, causing issues on the chain

## Summary
The pragma specification in the contract has not been set correctly, which can result in nonfunctional or damaged contracts when deployed on the Arbitrum network.
## Vulnerability Detail
The pragma directive in the contract has been set to `pragma solidity >=0.8.18;`, allowing the contract to be compiled with  **0.8.18** and grater version of the Solidity compiler. However, it is important to note that the Arbitrum network is not compatible with Solidity versions 0.8.20 and newer, as indicated in the Arbitrum Solidity Support documentation. Therefore, contracts compiled with these versions may exhibit unexpected behavior, potentially leading to nonfunctioning or damaged contracts.

By default, the compiler will use the latest version available, which means that contracts will be compiled with the 0.8.20 version. This can result in broken code when deployed on the Arbitrum network.

## Impact
Contracts are not usable when deployed on Arbitrum

## Recommendation
Set pragma:
```jsx
    pragma solidity 0.8.19;
```
Or constrain it:
```jsx
    pragma solidity  >=0.8.18 <=0.8.19;
```
