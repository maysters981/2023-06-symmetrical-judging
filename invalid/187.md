# Owner cannot be changed after deployment

## Summary

The owner of the `Diamond` contract cannot be changed after deployment.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `LibDiamond.setContractOwner` is called in the constructor of `Diamond.sol` and is not exposed in the `Diamond` contract. This means that the owner cannot be changed after deployment.

This function receives the address of the new owner and emits an event with the addresses of the previous and new owners, which implies that it is meant to be used to update the owner, and not only to set it once.

## Impact

The owner of the contract cannot be changed after deployment.

## Recommendation
