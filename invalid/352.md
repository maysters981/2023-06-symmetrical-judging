            upnlSig.upnl,
            msg.sender,
            origin
        );
        require(availableBalance >= 0, "PartyBFacet: Available balance is lower than zero");
        require(uint256(availableBalance) >= amount, "PartyBFacet: Will be liquidatable");

        accountLayout.partyBNonces[msg.sender][origin] += 1;
        accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[msg.sender][origin] -= amount;
        // allocate for recipient
        accountLayout.partyBNonces[msg.sender][recipient] += 1;
