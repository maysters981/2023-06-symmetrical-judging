# There is no way for the system to make sure the user Already got its pnl and take some action on it in `partyAAvailableForQuote`

## Summary
Since in this Function, we evaluate unpl as PartyA total unpl here is a way how PartyA can make a lot of positions on continuing pnl based on delta neutral position and take up a lot of the liquidity and requests

## Vulnerability Detail
steps:
PartyA  makes 5  eth positions 2 long and 3 short  and let's say eth falls 5 percent-> pnl=1000
PartyA makes  another of the same  5 positions  allocated=1 + 1000 - 300= 701 and we can create more positions  and now pnl=2000
PartyA makes another 5 positions  allocated  2000-1000=1000 units of tokens for positions and again and again 
to keep this up the PartyA just needs pnl which can be acquired from on-chain price movement and in that moment they can create these many positions 
The root cause is that pnl can keep growing with no check on how many positions are being taken
It's medium because it requires an unlikely scenario where PartyA gets lucky in pnl and the price keeps that way so he leverages the pnl and the system never checks that pnl is already used like other defi systems have.
## Impact
Loss of funds and no check in the state less unpl that has no check if used from the smart contracts at least
## Code Snippet
none just design issue that causes over leveraging and unfair advantage 
```solidity
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        int256 available;
        if (upnl >= 0) {
            available =
                int256(accountLayout.allocatedBalances[partyA]) +
                upnl -
                int256(
                    (accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].total() +
                        accountLayout.pendingLockedBalances[partyA].total())
                );
        } else {
            int256 mm = int256(accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].mm);
            int256 considering_mm = -upnl > mm ? -upnl : mm;
            available =
                int256(accountLayout.allocatedBalances[partyA]) -
                int256(
                    (accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].cva +
                        accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].lf +
                        accountLayout.pendingLockedBalances[partyA].total())
                ) -
                considering_mm;
        }
        return available;
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add another part of the sig that checks that pnl can only be used once in the system
```solidity
bool pnlUsed=True
//@reason: in next call that PartyA makes  it will revert not allowing him total unfair access to pnl 
require(pnlUsed==false)
```
