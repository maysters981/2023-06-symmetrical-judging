# Lack of input validation in `allocateAndLockQuote` function of PartyBFacet.sol

## Summary

The `allocateAndLockQuote` function in the `PartyBFacet` contract does not validate the `amount` input parameter, allowing it to be set to any arbitrary value.

## Vulnerability Detail

This function lacks proper input validation and thus, could potentially lead to an overflow or underflow condition depending on the input. 

## Impact 

This could potentially lead to unexpected behavior, such as creating or deleting a larger number of tokens than intended.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
AccountFacetImpl.allocateForPartyB(amount, quote.partyA, false);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

As a preventive measure, consider implementing checks to ensure that the input falls within the expected range.

## Proof Of Concept
 
1. Deploy the `PartyBFacet` and `AccountFacetImpl` contracts.
2. Call `allocateAndLockQuote` function with a very large `amount` parameter.
3. The contract's state changes in an unexpected way due to the large `amount` value.
