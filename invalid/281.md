# System can get into a state where user actions are paused while liquidations not

## Summary
It is possible to unfairly liquidate a user because user can not allocate any value to their positions because of pausing states.
## Vulnerability Detail
In order to avoid going into liquidation (for any party) user's can:
- close their positions(1)
- deposit and allocate new funds to their positions(2) 
- open hedge positions with some other party(3). 

However, it is very possible that users will not be able to use any of these solutions because of pausing states.
While there are too many scenarios that this situation can happen (because of too many pausing states) let's consider the easiest one:
1. PartyA has very negative upnl and will go into liquidation if won't do anything.
2. PartyA doesn't have any free balance to open new positions hence solution number 1 and 3 is impossible, only way is solution 2.
3.  Accounting is paused hence partyA can not deposit and allocate funds to avoid liquidation.
4. Liquidations are not paused, hence after some time partyA gets liquidated.

There are of course multiple scenarios that this situation can occur. For example If partyA actions are paused then even if partyA has allocated free balance, solution 1 and 3 won't work. Same is true for partyB as well.

## Impact
Users can not prevent their liquidation in certain pausing states hence get liquidated unfairly.

Manual Review

## Code Snippets
[AccountFacet.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol/#L13-L55)
```solidity
 function deposit(uint256 amount) external whenNotAccountingPaused {
        AccountFacetImpl.deposit(msg.sender, amount);
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.sender, amount);
    }

    function depositFor(address user, uint256 amount) external whenNotAccountingPaused {
        AccountFacetImpl.deposit(user, amount);
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, user, amount);
    }
...
 function allocate(
        uint256 amount
    ) external whenNotAccountingPaused notLiquidatedPartyA(msg.sender) {
        AccountFacetImpl.allocate(amount);
        emit AllocatePartyA(msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
(One example for partyA has been provided above. Consider all functions that won't work in paused states)

## Recommendation
Never put system into a state where repayments are paused and liquidations are enabled. Require that in order to put system into any of these situations:
-Accounting Paused
-PartyA Actions Paused
-PartyB Actions Paused
Liquidations must be first paused.
