# Precision loss due to integer underflow

## Summary
This issue is in the setSymbolsPrice function, Since the LIQUIDATOR_ROLEis untrusted, it can in error pass in a value leading to underflow
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function setSymbolsPrice(address partyA, PriceSig memory priceSig) internal {
        MAStorage.Layout storage maLayout = MAStorage.layout();
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();

        LibMuon.verifyPrices(priceSig, partyA);
        require(maLayout.liquidationStatus[partyA], "LiquidationFacet: PartyA is solvent");
        require(
             
            priceSig.timestamp <=
                maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout,
            "LiquidationFacet: Expired signature"
        );
        for (uint256 index = 0; index < priceSig.symbolIds.length; index++) {
            accountLayout.symbolsPrices[partyA][priceSig.symbolIds[index]] = Price(
                priceSig.prices[index],
                maLayout.liquidationTimestamp[partyA]
            );
        }

        int256 availableBalance = LibAccount.partyAAvailableBalanceForLiquidation(
            priceSig.upnl,
            partyA
        );
        if (accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationType == LiquidationType.NONE) {
            accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA] = LiquidationDetail({
                liquidationType: LiquidationType.NONE,
                upnl: priceSig.upnl,
                //@audit-issue can enter a positive value here Liquidator is semi trusted, therefore, through error it can input a positive value here

                totalUnrealizedLoss: priceSig.totalUnrealizedLoss,
                deficit: 0,
                liquidationFee: 0
            });
```
If a positive value is set as the priceSig.totalUnrealizedLoss, this value is unchecked as is set successfully
However, down the contract in the function liquidatePositionsPartyA

## Impact
Here the deficit is divided by the totalUnrealizedLoss however as we see here, There is an unprotected uint256 casting.
```solidity
        accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA] +=
                        amount -
                        ((amount * accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].deficit) /
                            uint256(-accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].totalUnrealizedLoss));
                }
```
Hence if the totalUnrealizedLoss set above is a positive value, There would be an integer underflow whereby the divisor would be abnormally large leading to a precision loss.
The deficit being deducted would be zero and ```accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA] +=amount``` no matter how large the deficit.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add checks within the contract to ensure that the totalUnrealizedLoss being added by the LIQUIDATOR_ROLE is actually less than zero.

Note: All roles are trusted except for LIQUIDATOR_ROLE.
