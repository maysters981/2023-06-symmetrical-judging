# Their is no limit on how many positions PartyB can take and it can cause dos in the system/free profit

## Summary
Since there is no check for How many Positions PartyB can take it can cause most of the functions relying on PartyBPending or open positions array to revert since of out of gas 
## Vulnerability Detail
So PartyB can make a lot of small orders and dos fill this and take a huge gamble with the position and then since we can't do anything with B functions  we will cause free profit/bad debt
so PartyB has no limit on how many positions it can take so PartyB fills up on million positions  and since they can't all be called at once for gas reasons liquidations on those positions won't happen 
so PartyB can construct this by having baby positions and then at later positions with risk positions and since PartyB has no limit or pending which can turn into openPositions with no limit 
2. OpenPosition won't work since it needs to remove a quote for pending which PartyB pending can be infinite 
3. PartyB liquidations won't work since it needs an array 
4.  removing Pending won't work 
## Impact
Dos/ PartyB can  construct  to remove some and with high gas when the profit is right

```solidity

        accountLayout.partyANonces[quote.partyA] += 1;
        accountLayout.partyBNonces[quote.partyB][quote.partyA] += 1;
        quote.modifyTimestamp = block.timestamp;

        LibQuote.removeFromPendingQuotes(quote);

        if (quote.quantity == filledAmount) {
            accountLayout.pendingLockedBalances[quote.partyA].subQuote(quote);
            accountLayout.partyBPendingLockedBalances[quote.partyB][quote.partyA].subQuote(quote);
//-> removeFromPendingQuotes
   function removeFromPartyBPendingQuotes(Quote storage quote) internal {
        removeFromArray(
            QuoteStorage.layout().partyBPendingQuotes[quote.partyB][quote.partyA],
            quote.id
        );
    }

    function removeFromPendingQuotes(Quote storage quote) internal {
        removeFromPartyAPendingQuotes(quote);
        removeFromPartyBPendingQuotes(quote);
    }
//-> openPosition
    LibQuote.removeFromOpenPositions(quote.id);
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Have A limit in openPosition function and lockQuote on how many pending PartyB can take
