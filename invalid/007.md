# Unrestricted Liquidation Role Assignment

## Summary

The LiquidationFacet smart contract currently doesn't have any restrictions for assigning the `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` role. Anyone can be assigned the role, which enables them to liquidate any party (partyA or partyB) or set symbol prices. This vulnerability could allow malicious actors to compromise the system's integrity and lead to unfair liquidations or price manipulations.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `LiquidationFacet` contract, the `liquidatePartyA`, `liquidatePartyB`, `setSymbolsPrice`, `liquidatePositionsPartyA`, `liquidatePositionsPartyB`, and `liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA` functions are protected by the `onlyRole(LibAccessibility.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE)` modifier. This means that only accounts with the `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` can call these functions. However, there's no restriction on who can be assigned this role, and thus, it's a security concern.

## Impact

If a malicious actor obtains the `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE`, they can manipulate prices or liquidate positions arbitrarily, which could lead to significant financial losses for other parties and undermine the integrity and trust in the system.

## Code Snippet

The following code snippet from the `LiquidationFacet.sol` contract shows the issue:

```solidity
function liquidatePartyA(
    address partyA,
    SingleUpnlSig memory upnlSig
)
external
whenNotLiquidationPaused
notLiquidatedPartyA(partyA)
onlyRole(LibAccessibility.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE)
{
    LiquidationFacetImpl.liquidatePartyA(partyA, upnlSig);
    emit LiquidatePartyA(msg.sender, partyA);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A possible solution to this vulnerability is to add restrictions for assigning the `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE`. This role should only be assigned to trusted entities or through a decentralized governance process. Furthermore, you could implement a multi-signature scheme where multiple trusted entities must agree before a liquidation or price setting action is executed.

## Proof Of Concept

Here's a hypothetical scenario to demonstrate this vulnerability:

1. Deploy the `LiquidationFacet` contract on a local Ethereum blockchain.
2. Assign the `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` to an arbitrary account (which can be done by the contract owner or any account with the role assignment capability).
3. Use this account to call `liquidatePartyA` or `setSymbolsPrice`, passing arbitrary values as parameters.
4. Observe that the account can execute these actions without any restrictions, which could lead to undesired liquidations or price manipulations.
