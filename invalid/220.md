# DiamondLoupFacet will return facets addresses indicating they implement wrong function selectors.

# DiamondLoupFacet.sol#DiamondLoupFacet will return facets addresses indicating they implement wrong function selectors.

## Summary

The replaceFunctions function updates only the facetAddress of the FacetAddressSelectorPosition it does not update the selectors array from the DiamondStorage struct. As a result DiamondLoupFacet will return facets addresses indicating they implement wrong function selectors.

## Vulnerability Detail

[LibDiamond.sol#L117-L141](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibDiamond.sol#L117-L141)

The replaceFunctions function updates only the facetAddress of the FacetAddressSelectorPosition it does not update the selectors array from the DiamondStorage struct. If you are updating a facet where for example the facet being updated has 4 functions and the new facect has 5 functions and/or if these functions have different selectors the selectors array won't be updated and the FacetAddressAndSelectorPosition.selectorPosition will point to a wrong element from the selectors array. Later on this will cause removeFunctions to remove the wrong elements from the selectors array as well. As a result DiamondLoupFacet facets() https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/DiamondLoupFacet.sol#L16-L65 will return facets addresses indicating they implement wrong function selectors. As well as facetFunctionSelectors() https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/DiamondLoupFacet.sol#L70-L93

    struct FacetAddressAndSelectorPosition {
        address facetAddress;
        uint16 selectorPosition;
    }

    struct DiamondStorage {
        // function selector => facet address and selector position in selectors array
        mapping(bytes4 => FacetAddressAndSelectorPosition) facetAddressAndSelectorPosition;
        bytes4[] selectors;
        mapping(bytes4 => bool) supportedInterfaces;
        // owner of the contract
        address contractOwner;
    }

Q: Is the code/contract expected to comply with any EIPs? Are there specific assumptions around adhering to those EIPs that Watsons should be aware of?
        
ERC-2535: Diamonds, Multi-Facet Proxy
Create modular smart contract systems that can be extended after deployment.

And per the ERC-2525: 
Using Function Selectors
User interface software can be used to retrieve function selectors and face addresses from a diamond in order show what functions a diamond has. This standard is designed to make diamonds work well with user-interface software. Function selectors with the ABI of a contract provide enough information about functions to be useful for user-interface software.
 
 Example: 
 After executing addFunctions(0xadderess1, [00, 11, 22, 33, 44]) we have the following 
 selectors: [00, 11, 22, 33, 44] (imagine 00 are function selectors)
 facetAddressAndSelectorPosition:
  00 => {
    facetAddress: 0xadderess1;
    selectorPosition: 0;
  },
   11 => {
    facetAddress: 0xadderess1;
    selectorPosition: 1;
  },
   22 => {
    facetAddress: 0xadderess1;
    selectorPosition: 2;
  },
   33 => {
    facetAddress: 0xadderess1;
    selectorPosition: 3;
  },
   44 => {
    facetAddress: 0xadderess1;
    selectorPosition: 4;
  }

  then we execute function replaceFunctions(0xadderess1, [55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 67])

  selectors: [00, 11, 22, 33, 44] still the same 
 facetAddressAndSelectorPosition:
  55 => {
    facetAddress: 0xadderess1;
    selectorPosition: 0;
  },
   66 => {
    facetAddress: 0xadderess1;
    selectorPosition: 1;
  },
   77 => {
    facetAddress: 0xadderess1;
    selectorPosition: 2;
  },
   88 => {
    facetAddress: 0xadderess1;
    selectorPosition: 3;
  },
   99 => {
    facetAddress: 0xadderess1;
    selectorPosition: 4;
  },
   67 => {
    facetAddress: 0xadderess1;
    selectorPosition: 0;
  }

calling DiamondLoup.sol facetFunctionSelectors(0xadderess1) will return [00, 11, 22, 33, 44] when the correct ouput should be [55, 66, 77, 88, 99, 67]. Calling LibDiamond.sol removeFunctions() furter mismatches facets to function selectors.

## Impact

DiamondLoupFacet facets() https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/DiamondLoupFacet.sol#L16-L65 will return facets addresses indicating they implement wrong function selectors. As well as facetFunctionSelectors() https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/DiamondLoupFacet.sol#L70-L93.
