# Liquidators will always make more profit by avoiding liquidating partyA's pending quotes

## Summary
Liquidators will always make more profit by avoiding liquidating partyA's pending quotes.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the current design, liquidating party A's pending quotes and liquidating party A's opened quote are done independently, and there is no reward for liquidating partyA's pending quotes. As a result, there is no incentive for liquidators to liquidate partyA's pending quotes;  liquidators will just liquidate partyA's  currently opened quotes, and leave pending quotes there . When some partyBs open positions for these quotes, there will be chances that partyA account will fall below liquidation threshold again, hence giving liquidators more profit.

Additionally, liquidation check does not take locked pending balance into account. So after liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA() being called and liquidation status is set to false, partyB can totally open quotes which were sent before liquidation.


## Impact
In most cases, partyA's pending quotes will remain after liquidation while they should be removed ( partyB liquidation function does implement removing pending positions).

liquidatePartyA() should include liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA().
