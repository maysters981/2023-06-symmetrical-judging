# Missing Initializer in ControlFacet.sol

## Summary
The ControlFacet.sol is missing an initializer modifier on the init function, allows a malicious owner to re-initialize it. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The ControlFacet.sol 

    function init(address user, address collateral, address feeCollector) external onlyOwner {
        MAStorage.Layout storage maLayout = MAStorage.layout();

As you can see, it has no modifier and allows for re-initialization.
## Impact
This Allows a malicious owner to change the collateral address, the user and also the fee collector at will, and this is too much power given to the onlyOwner, where the could manipulate and scam, users at will.

## Recommendation
Import open Zeppeline's initializable.sol library and make use of the initializer modifier to guard against future, re-intialization
