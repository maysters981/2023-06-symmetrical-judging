# liquidatePositionsPartyA when we close the positions the pending wont be cleared and length wont be decreased

## Summary
same issue as not popping off the array but reverting in a different place 
## Vulnerability Detail
We don't pop off the array for pending when liquidating for PartyA so when we liquidate our last open Position it will revert causing reverts 
## Impact
This is high since liquidations won't be able to happen for certain edge cases like when we can't pop off the array for pending and when PartyA liquidated their last position and some positions that are not able to be closed/liquidated
## Code Snippet

```solidity

        if (quoteLayout.partyAPositionsCount[partyA] == 0) {
            require(
                quoteLayout.partyAPendingQuotes[partyA].length == 0,
                "LiquidationFacet: Pending quotes should be liquidated first"
            );
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add popping from the array other wise don't allow those positions not to get liquidated
