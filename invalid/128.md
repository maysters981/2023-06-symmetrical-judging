# PartyAFacetImpl.sendQuote checks if lf amount is enough incorrectly

## Summary
PartyAFacetImpl.sendQuote checks if lf amount is enough incorrectly
## Vulnerability Detail
When user creates quote then he provides `lf`, `cva`, `mm`. These are then [packed into `lockedValues`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L47).
Later there is a check that `lf` amount was provided enough.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L55-L60
```solidity
        require(
            lockedValues.lf >=
                (symbolLayout.symbols[symbolId].minAcceptablePortionLF * lockedValues.total()) /
                    1e18,
            "PartyAFacet: LF is not enough"
        );
```
In order to do the check whole locked values is checked to have at least `minAcceptablePortionLF` percentage of `lf`.
Let's understand what is `lf`, `mm`, `cva`.
`mm` is actual amount that is holding the position. It's like collateral that is available for the position.
`cva` is amount that will be paid to another party in case of liquidation. it's not guaranteed that all `cva` will be paid. In case if losses are big, then some part or all `cva` can be taken to cover losses. 
`lf` is the amount that is going to be paid to liquidators. However this is not guaranteed, in case of losses of user, then this `lf` amount will be decreased and its even possible that whole `lf` amount will be set to 0 and liquidator will not receive payment.

```solidity
            if (availableBalance >= 0) {
                uint256 remainingLf = accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].lf;
                accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationType = LiquidationType.NORMAL;
                accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationFee = remainingLf;
            } else if (uint256(-availableBalance) < accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].lf) {
                uint256 remainingLf = accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].lf -
                    uint256(-availableBalance);
                accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationType = LiquidationType.NORMAL;
                accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationFee = remainingLf;
            } else if (
                uint256(-availableBalance) <=
                accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].lf + accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].cva
            ) {
                uint256 deficit = uint256(-availableBalance) -
                    accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].lf;
                accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationType = LiquidationType.LATE;
                accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].deficit = deficit;
            } else {
                uint256 deficit = uint256(-availableBalance) -
                    accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].lf -
                    accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].cva;
                accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].liquidationType = LiquidationType.OVERDUE;
                accountLayout.liquidationDetails[partyA].deficit = deficit;
            }
```

That actually means, that `lf` doesn't have any relation with `cva` from the liquidator's perspective. And from this perspective it should depend on `mm` only.

That's why i believe that calculation is not correct and partyA overpays sometimes.

Example:
There are 2 quotes with locked values: lf:10, mm:45, cva:45 and lf:10, mm:80, cva:10
As you can see in second case lf/mm is much less. As we need to cover `mm` we need to provide 4.5 in one case and 8 in another.
But currently user needs to provide 10.
## Impact
partyA overpays for liquidation.

## Recommendation
Check enough `lf` based on `mm` only.
