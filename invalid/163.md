# Lack of check on if Symbol is valid when opens a quote

## Summary

Lack of check on if Symbol is valid when opens a quote.

## Vulnerability Detail

Party A opens a quote with a [symbolId](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L23C17-L23C25), it requires that the Symbol with this symbolId must be valid:
```solidity
        require(symbolLayout.symbols[symbolId].isValid, "PartyAFacet: Symbol is not valid");
```
After this quote has been sent, PartyB can lock and open the quote, during the process, it doesn't check if the Symbol with this symbolId is valid or not. This could be a problem because the Symbol could be invalidated by a Symbol Manager:
```solidity
    function setSymbolValidationState(
        uint256 symbolId,
        bool isValid
    ) external onlyRole(LibAccessibility.SYMBOL_MANAGER_ROLE) {
        SymbolStorage.Layout storage symbolLayout = SymbolStorage.layout();
        require(symbolId >= 1 && symbolId <= symbolLayout.lastId, "ControlFacet: Invalid id");
        emit SetSymbolValidationState(symbolId, symbolLayout.symbols[symbolId].isValid, isValid);
        symbolLayout.symbols[symbolId].isValid = isValid;
    }
```
If the Symbol is invalidated before the quote is opened, then the quote will be opened with an invalid Symbol.

## Impact

Quote could be opened with an invalid Symbol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Please consider to add check on if quote is opened with a valid Symbol when PartyB opens a quote.
```diff
        Quote storage quote = quoteLayout.quotes[quoteId];
        require(
            quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.LOCKED ||
            quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.CANCEL_PENDING,
            "PartyBFacet: Invalid state"
        );
        require(block.timestamp <= quote.deadline, "PartyBFacet: Quote is expired");
+        require(symbolLayout.symbols[quote.symbolId].isValid, "PartyAFacet: Symbol is not valid");
```
