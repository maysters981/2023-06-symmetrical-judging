# Lack of Access Control on Key Functions in LibDiamond.sol

## Summary

Several functions within the LibDiamond.sol contract lack appropriate access control, which could potentially allow any user to execute them and modify the contract state.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the LibDiamond.sol contract, several functions that can manipulate the contract's state, such as `setContractOwner`, `addFunctions`, `replaceFunctions`, and `removeFunctions`, lack a function modifier that restricts access to these functions. This could potentially allow any user to execute them.

## Impact

An attacker could take over the contract by changing the contract owner or modifying functions as they see fit.

## Code Snippet

Code sections affected are:

- setContractOwner function in LibDiamond.sol

- addFunctions function in LibDiamond.sol

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibDiamond.sol#L95-L115

- replaceFunctions function in LibDiamond.sol

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibDiamond.sol#L117-L141

- removeFunctions function in LibDiamond.sol

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement access control checks such as `onlyOwner` or `onlyAdmin` modifiers on functions that can manipulate the contract state.

## Proof Of Concept (Steps in order to reproduce the vulnerability)

1. Deploy a fresh instance of the contract.
2. From an account that is not the contract owner, try calling `setContractOwner` function with the attacker's address as the parameter.
3. If the call is successful, it shows that the function lacks proper access control.
