# Using spot trading fee to compute the refunded amount lead to a loss of funds

## Summary

The trading fee to be refunded to users is computed dynamically based on the spot/latest trading fee. This could lead to funds being stolen from the protocol, or the user's trading fee could be lost as fewer than expected are refunded to the users.

```solidity
File: LibQuote.sol
122:     function getTradingFee(uint256 quoteId) internal view returns (uint256 fee) {
123:         QuoteStorage.Layout storage quoteLayout = QuoteStorage.layout();
124:         Quote storage quote = quoteLayout.quotes[quoteId];
125:         Symbol storage symbol = SymbolStorage.layout().symbols[quote.symbolId];
126:         if (quote.orderType == OrderType.LIMIT) {
127:             fee =
128:                 (LibQuote.quoteOpenAmount(quote) * quote.requestedOpenPrice * symbol.tradingFee) /
129:                 1e36;
130:         } else {
131:             fee = (LibQuote.quoteOpenAmount(quote) * quote.marketPrice * symbol.tradingFee) / 1e36;
132:         }
133:     }
134: 
135:     function returnTradingFee(uint256 quoteId) internal {
136:         AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
137:         uint256 tradingFee = LibQuote.getTradingFee(quoteId);
138:         accountLayout.allocatedBalances[QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId].partyA] += tradingFee;
139:         accountLayout.balances[GlobalAppStorage.layout().feeCollector] -= tradingFee;
140:     }
```

The amount of trading fee returned to the users is computed dynamically when the `returnTradingFee` function is triggered. In general, the following formula is used to compute the trading fee at any point in time. In the testing script, $TradingFeePercent$ is set to $1\%$.

$Trading Fee = Amount\times Price \times TradingFeePercent$

Following is the proof-of-concept on how a malicious user could exploit the fact that the trading fee to be refunded to users is computed dynamically based on the spot/latest trading fee to steal funds from the protocol:

1) Assume that Bob creates a quote/position with a notional value of 1,000,000 USD, and the trading fee is 1%. In this case, Bob will pay and transfer 10,000 USD to the protocol as the trading fee.
2) Bob intentionally set the quote's `partyBsWhiteList` to `address(0)` so that this position will always remain at the "PENDING" state.
3) The protocol manager updates the trading fee to 5% sometime later.
4) Bob canceled the pending quote, and the protocol refunded him 50,000 USD
5) Bob profits 40,000 USD (50,000 USD - 10,000 USD).

On the other hand, if the protocol manager updates the trading fee from 1% to 0.5%, users who create the positions before the update and subsequently cancel the position after the update loses half of their trading fee for no reason.

## Impact

Funds could be stolen from the protocol, or the user's trading fee could be lost as fewer than expected are refunded to the users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider keeping track of how much trading fee was being paid in the first place when the position/quote was created. In this example, 10,000 USD of the trading fee is paid by Bob. Thus, the trading fee returned should more or less than what he originally paid (10,000 USD)
