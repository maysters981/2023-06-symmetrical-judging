# User can avoid unfavorable position closing by deallocating funds

## Summary
User can avoid unfavorable position closing by deallocating funds
## Vulnerability Detail
There are 2 cases when position can be closed: when [user requested it](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L148) or when partyB does [emergency close](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L309).

So in first option `fillCloseRequest` function will be closed by partyB, which will check if [both parties are solvent](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L288) after the close.
The same check is present [inside `emergencyClosePosition` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L317).

partyA can use this check to make only favorable closes. In case if he sees that this position close is not good for him anymore and will create additional losses, he can forntrun any of `fillCloseRequest` or `emergencyClosePosition` function and deallocate some amount of free funds, which is enough to make `LibSolvency.isSolventAfterClosePosition` function revert and do not allow to close position.
## Impact
User can not allow to close position.
