# A partyA/B can Dos own liquidation because liquidation relies on a nonced signature

## Summary
A partyA can Dos own liquidation because liquidation relies on a nonced signature.

## Vulnerability Detail
We can see that liquidation for partyA relies on a nonced signature, which is fetched directly from the on-chain value:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L23

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibMuon.sol#L87-L106

however, since partyA can increment this value indefinitely by allocating or deallocating a small amount:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L41-L52

partyA can prevent a liquidator to ever have a valid signature to proceed with the liquidation by doing one of these operations at every block.

Note that a partyB can Dos its own liquidation in a similar way since it relies on a signature of `AccountStorage.layout().partyBNonces[partyB][partyA]`, which can be incremented by allocating/deallocating:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L119-L132

## Impact
partyA or partyB can prevent its own liquidation indefinitely and thus increase deficit of the protocol

## Recommendation
Check if partyA, partyB is liquidatable (!= liquidating, which is already checked) for any operation incrementing its nonce
