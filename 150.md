# partyA is forever stuck with open positions and partyB is stuck forever in liquidation status if liquidatePositionsPartyB is not called within 2 * liquidationTimeout seconds window

## Summary

Liquidating partyB is a 2-step process. First, liquidator calls `liquidatePartyB`, and then `liquidatePositionsPartyB` can be called 1 or more times until all positions are liquidated. However, due to timeout checks, if `liquidatePositionsPartyB` is called later than `2 * liquidationTime` seconds away from `liquidatePartyB` transaction, it will always revert. This will keep partyB in liquidation status forever, and for partyA lockedBalances for positions with partyB will stay forever, preventing partyA from deallocating all the funds from these positions.

## Vulnerability Detail

`liquidatePartyB` function sets a timestamp of the start of liquidation process (which is liquidation price signature timestamp):

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L273

`liquidatePositionsPartyB` has 2 `require`'s for timestamp:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L318-L322

and

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L327-L330

`priceSig.timestamp <= maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout` (1)

`block.timestamp <= priceSig.timestamp + maLayout.liquidationTimeout` (2)

Substituting (1) into (2) we get:

`block.timestamp <= maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] + maLayout.liquidationTimeout + maLayout.liquidationTimeout`

or

`block.timestamp <= maLayout.partyBLiquidationTimestamp[partyB][partyA] + 2 * maLayout.liquidationTimeout`

This means that `liquidatePositionsPartyB` requires current block timestamp to be earlier than `2 * liquidationTimeout` away from the start of liquidation time. Once current block is later than this, this function will always revert, making it impossible to finalize partyB's liquidation and free up partyA's lockedBalances.

## Impact

In case of liquidators being late to finish PartyB liquidation (for example, due to network congestion):

1. PartyA's lockedBalances from positions with PartyB will stay forever, meaning PartyA's funds from PartyB positions will be stuck forever, and can not be unallocated, effectively losing funds for PartyA.

2. PartyB will stay forever in liquidation state, meaning that PartyA can not open any new quotes/positions with PartyB.

3. Liquidators will never finish the liquidation process of PartyB and will not get their share of liquidation fees, meaning liquidation fees are lost forever.

## Code Snippet

Add this to any test, for example to `ClosePosition.behavior.ts`.

```ts
it("Balance not unlocked for partyB liquidation", async function () {
  const context: RunContext = this.context;

  this.user_allocated = decimal(1000);
  this.hedger_allocated = decimal(1000);

  this.user = new User(this.context, this.context.signers.user);
  await this.user.setup();
  await this.user.setBalances(this.user_allocated, this.user_allocated, this.user_allocated);

  this.hedger = new Hedger(this.context, this.context.signers.hedger);
  await this.hedger.setup();
  await this.hedger.setBalances(this.hedger_allocated, this.hedger_allocated);

  this.liquidator = new User(this.context, this.context.signers.liquidator);
  await this.liquidator.setup();

  // open position
  await this.user.sendQuote(limitQuoteRequestBuilder().quantity(decimal(500)).build());
  await this.hedger.lockQuote(1, 0, decimal(1));
  await this.hedger.openPosition(1, limitOpenRequestBuilder().filledAmount(decimal(500)).build());

  await context.liquidationFacet.liquidatePartyB(
    this.hedger.signer.address,
    this.user.signer.address,
    await getDummySingleUpnlSig(decimal(-1000)),
  );

  var timeout = await context.viewFacet.liquidationTimeout();
  console.log("liquidation timeout: " + timeout);

  // signature at the correct time
  var validSig = await getDummyQuotesPriceSig([1], [0]);

  await time.increase(300);

  var invalidSig = await getDummyQuotesPriceSig([1], [0]);

  console.log("After 300 seconds, current signature reverts due to expired signature (too much time since liquidation started)");
  await expect(
    context.liquidationFacet.connect(this.liquidator.signer).liquidatePositionsPartyB(
      this.hedger.signer.address,
      this.user.signer.address,
      invalidSig,
    )
  ).to.be.revertedWith('LiquidationFacet: Expired signature')

  console.log("Valid (old) signature reverts due to expired price signature (too much time from price signature to current block time)");
  await expect(
    context.liquidationFacet.connect(this.liquidator.signer).liquidatePositionsPartyB(
      this.hedger.signer.address,
      this.user.signer.address,
      validSig,
    )
  ).to.be.revertedWith('LiquidationFacet: Expired price sig')

  var liquidated = await context.viewFacet.isPartyBLiquidated(this.hedger.signer.address, this.user.signer.address);
  console.log("PartyB Liquidated: " + liquidated);

  var info = await this.user.getBalanceInfo();
  console.log("partyA allocated: " + info.allocatedBalances / 1e18 + " locked: " + info.totalLocked/1e18 + " pendingLocked: " + info.totalPendingLocked / 1e18);
  var info = await this.hedger.getBalanceInfo(this.user.getAddress());
  console.log("partyB allocated: " + info.allocatedBalances / 1e18 + " locked: " + info.totalLocked/1e18 + " pendingLocked: " + info.totalPendingLocked / 1e18);
});
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It appears both require's for signature timestamp are not required, because all funds are distributed in the 1st step of the liquidation process, and in the 2nd step - the prices from signature are only used to set quote's closing price, so even if some old prices are used, that won't break anything in the protocol. The fix can be just deleting these 2 require's:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L318-L322

and

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L327-L330

Deleting just the 2nd require should also be enough (but will require "old" signature if transaction is not submitted in time).
