# [07:04 127]-H  In the liquidation case, The protocol steals the `TradingFee` of the pending quote

## Summary
PartyA will lose the `TradingFee` to the protocol in case he gets liquidated. even if these funds could be used to improve the liquidation type or reduce the losing funds of PartB

## Vulnerability Detail
[liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L99-L124) should invoke `returnTradingFee()` so these funds will help in case `LiquidationType.OVERDUE` or `LATE` to pay the `deficit` or even in `NORMAL` LiquidationType add it to `cva` or `lf`

## Impact
- The protocol has the money to improve the liquidation But it keeps the funds to himself

## Recommendation
invoke `returnTradingFee()` in `liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA()`
