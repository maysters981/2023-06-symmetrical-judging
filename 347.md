# Unsafe casting of int256 to uint256 could lead to overflow and Incorrect calculation.

## Summary
In the LiquidatePartyB function, its logic tree does a check that involves an unsafe casting an init to a uint256 which can lead to and overflow and a wrong values checked.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the LiquidatePartyB function

        int256 availableBalance = LibAccount.partyBAvailableBalanceForLiquidation(
            upnlSig.upnl,
            partyB,
            partyA
        );

        require(availableBalance < 0, "LiquidationFacet: partyB is solvent");
        uint256 liquidatorShare;
        uint256 remainingLf;
        if (uint256(-availableBalance) < accountLayout.partyBLockedBalances[partyB][partyA].lf) {
            remainingLf =

Casting an Init to uint this way will cause a silent flow where the value is change.

## Impact
This could lead to incorrect value checks and could be exploited to manipulate the liquation of Party B.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make use of a sol's safeCast Library when casting.
