# Malicious Party A can prevent Party B from emergency closing a position on a market price.

## Summary
Malicious Party A who doesn't want the position to be closed on a market price can temporary DoS Party B from closing the position in emergency mode.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the protocol is in emergency mode or the user has the emergency status given to him. He is able to emergency close a position on the market price.

This is exploitable incase Party A is malicious and doesn't want the position to be closed at a market price.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Malicious Parties should not be able to prevent closing a position on market price in emergency mode. 

The function emergencyClosePosition should be callable when the quote status is in CLOSE_PENDING as well:

```solidity
    function emergencyClosePosition(uint256 quoteId, PairUpnlAndPriceSig memory upnlSig) internal {
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        Quote storage quote = QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId];
        require(quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.OPENED || quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.CLOSE_PENDING , "PartyBFacet: Invalid state");
        LibMuon.verifyPairUpnlAndPrice(upnlSig, quote.partyB, quote.partyA, quote.symbolId);
        uint256 filledAmount = LibQuote.quoteOpenAmount(quote);
        quote.quantityToClose = filledAmount;
        quote.requestedClosePrice = upnlSig.price;
        LibSolvency.isSolventAfterClosePosition(quoteId, filledAmount, upnlSig.price, upnlSig);
        accountLayout.partyBNonces[quote.partyB][quote.partyA] += 1;
        accountLayout.partyANonces[quote.partyA] += 1;
        LibQuote.closeQuote(quote, filledAmount, upnlSig.price);
    }

}
```
