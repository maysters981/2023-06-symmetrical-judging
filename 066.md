# Expired signature can stuck all Party positions in a liquidation state.

## Summary
Expired signature can stuck all Party positions in a liquidation state.

## Vulnerability Detail
If we look over the liquidation path of Party A when setting the symbol prices, we can see that there is a liquidation timer before the signature expires.

This is a problem because once the signature expires, there is now way to set the symbol price for the given quote and therefore the liquidation of Party A can't be finished. On the other part the function liquidatePartyA can't be called a second time to reset the liquidation timestamp, because Party A already has the liquidation status.

Path to successfully finish the liquidation of Party A:

liquidatePartyA -> setSymbolPrices -> liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA -> liquidatePositionsPartyA

Which means that Party A positions are permanently stuck on the user's side. And until the liquidation is complete Party A can't use most of the protocol duo to the liquidation status.

Incase this issue occurs, the protocol team will need to manually change the liquidationTimestamp for every expired signature there is in order to fix the issue and unstuck the liquidation.

Note - the issue also occurs when liquidating Party B.

## Impact
Expired signature permanently DoS Party A liquidation on the user's side.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be a way to reset the liquidation timestamp of a Party on the user's side. Instead of the need to manually change the liquidation timeout for every expired signature there is.
