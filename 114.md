# User's funds could get staked for a period of time

## Summary
The protocol collecting the fees by invoking [LibQuote.receiveTradingFee()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L119) on every time a PartyA call [sendQuote()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L21C14-L120) successfully 

## Vulnerability Detail
In the case `GlobalAppStorage.layout().feeCollector` decided to withdraw his all balance.

This will affect [acceptCancelRequest()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L70) and [requestToCancelQuote()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L136) and make both of them no longer work

How?
[returnTradingFee()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibQuote.sol#L135-L140) will revert do you to underflow error in this line 
```solidity
accountLayout.balances[GlobalAppStorage.layout().feeCollector] -= tradingFee;
```
Because the balance of `feeCollector` is zero.

## Impact
- Both PartyA and PartyB are not able to cancel/acceptCancel their Quote 
- User's funds get staked until a PartyA creates a new Quote or `feeCollector` deposits some funds  

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol#L26-L29
```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external whenNotAccountingPaused notSuspended(msg.sender) {
        AccountFacetImpl.withdraw(msg.sender, amount);
        emit Withdraw(msg.sender, msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
