# liquidator can only call liquidatePartyA twice, or liquidatorPartyA + setSymbolPrice without completing the 4-step since only first 2 callers get all liquidation fee

## Summary
liquidator can only call liquidatePartyA twice, or liquidatorPartyA + setSymbolPrice without completing the 4-step since only first 2 callers get all liquidation fee

## Vulnerability Detail
At the end of the 4-step liquidation (liquidatePositionPartyA), liquidation fee is split among the first two addresses at the list of liquidator.

```solidity
            if (lf > 0) {
                accountLayout.allocatedBalances[accountLayout.liquidators[partyA][0]] += lf / 2;
                accountLayout.allocatedBalances[accountLayout.liquidators[partyA][1]] += lf / 2;
            }
```

This means if a liquidator simply calls the first two steps, or just call liquidatePartyA twice; they could let other persons to do the rest (like the partyB who would like to get the liquidation penalty or free their lockedValue); Moreover if also means back-running of liquidation being profitable (simply copy all liquidatePartyA calls at mempool to backrun). 

## Impact
liquidation fee is MEVable.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
consider only allow addresses that has non-zero deposit amount in the protocol as a qualified liquidators, this could eliminator most straight-forward MEVer.
