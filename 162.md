# Abuse of quote lock-unlock cycle can trap partyA's quotes

## Summary
A malicious actor (PartyB) can essentially block a quote issued by another actor (PartyA) from being filled by others. PartyB accomplishes this by continually locking and unlocking the quote without opening a position.
## Vulnerability Detail
In a scenario where partyA submits a quote, there is potential for a malicious partyB to exploit the system by locking the quote without actually opening a position. Upon recognizing partyB's inaction, partyA may opt to invoke the requestToCancelQuote function, which sets the quote to a CANCEL_PENDING status and triggers a countdown for partyB to respond. If partyB continues to remain passive, partyA can then execute the forceCancelQuote function to cancel the quote entirely.

However, partyB can manipulate the system by waiting until the countdown is nearly complete and then swiftly invoking the unlock and lock quote functions, thereby resetting the process. This can lead to a situation where partyA is forced to undergo the same set of procedures repeatedly, while partyB prevents other potential parties from locking partyA's quote. Further, if partyA had initially submitted the quote with an extended deadline, partyB's strategy could potentially leave partyA's quote in a suspended state indefinitely.
