# `sendQuote`: Fee collection at last can itself make a position underwater

## Summary
The `sendQuote` function collects the fee at last (after performing all collateral validations). This can instantly make the partyA and his positions unhealthy. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The sendQuote function here (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L119) collects the trading fee at last. 

If the user invokes this function with the intention of creating the maximum possible position, then after fee collection the account will become eligible for liquidation (as allocated balance is decreased during fee collection).

## Impact
The protocol natively allows creation of positions which makes a partyA eligible for liquidation instantly. This is not an ideal outcome for Symmetrical protocol. The fee must be taken into consideration while validating the account's health and liquidation status.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider deducting fee at the top of function or consider including the to-be-deducted fee amount into determining the account's health and liquidation status.
