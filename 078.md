# Storage Layout of MuonStorage could face storage collision if more fields are added to PublicKey field

## Summary
Storage Layout of MuonStorage library uses a structure directly in its declaration. This puts a limitation that new fields cannot be added to PublicKey structure any more, else it will cause collision in storage in future upgrades.

## Vulnerability Detail
It is advised to not put structs directly in another struct as you won't be able to add new state variables to inner structs in upgrades. Doing so will  results in overwriting the storage slot of variables declared after the struct.

It is better to leave flexibility for upgrade rather than locking the storage layout. The limitation is only on adding new fields to PublicKey  field only, and does not apply to Layout struct.

## Impact
If there is a need to add more fields to PublicKey struct, it will create issues for future upgrades and will impact the storage of struct Layout.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/storages/MuonStorage.sol#L15-L18

```solidity
struct PublicKey {
    uint256 x;
    uint8 parity;
}
```

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/storages/MuonStorage.sol#L76-L93

```solidity
 struct Layout {
        uint256 upnlValidTime;
        uint256 priceValidTime;
        uint256 priceQuantityValidTime;
        uint256 muonAppId;
        PublicKey muonPublicKey; //@audit, this introduces a limitation that new fields cannot be added to PublicKey
        address validGateway;       // adding new field will result in storage collision.
    }
```

**POC:**
for demo, Lets say, there was a need to add address to struct PublicKey. 
```solidity
struct PublicKey {
    uint256 x;
    uint8 parity;
    address underlyingAccount;
}
```

this change in struct will have a storage collision with validGateway. if some one wsa updating the PublicKey's underlyingAccount, for old records, they would be updating it on validGateway which is part of Layout Struct.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To leave the structure flexible, it is better to add PublicKey to mapping like below and reference it via a constant string.
mapping (string=>PublicKey) public muonPublicKeys;

As part of norms of diamond pattern, it is recommended not to add structures inside a structure.
Also as additional info, should not add array of structure.
