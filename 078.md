# Diamond Proxy pattern would break for functions that accept structs as parameters

## Summary
Diamond Proxy patterns identifies the function using first four bytes of the function signature. The function signature is based on the name and parameter types which are stored in the mapping. The diamond proxy uses  "msg.sig" to resolve and call the correct function at the address based on msg.sig.

The issue is with functions that accepts structs as parameters. As such functions are vulnerable to change in address as and when a  new field to the struct. This will change the address and Diamond Proxy might not be able to resolve for contracts that was tied to an address earlier.  This could break the system, the proxy is pointing to.

## Vulnerability Detail

**POC for the potential issue:**

In the AccountFacet contract, there are three functions that uses struct as listed below.

a) deallocate
b) deallocateForPartyB
c) transferAllocation

All these functions uses struct **SingleUpnlSig** as a parameter.

struct SingleUpnlSig {
    bytes reqId;
    uint256 timestamp;
    int256 upnl;
    bytes gatewaySignature;
    SchnorrSign sigs;
}

Lets deploy the contract and generate the mapping.

**Mapping before changing the structure**

**AccountFacet deployed**: 0xDc64a140Aa3E981100a9becA4E685f962f0cF6C9
[
  {
    facetAddress: '0xDc64a140Aa3E981100a9becA4E685f962f0cF6C9',
    action: 0,
    **functionSelectors:** [
      '0x90ca796b', '0xcd0bac16',
      '0xea002a7b', '0xa3b298c9',
      '0xb6b55f25', '0xddabc862',
      '0xbeacd367', '0x2f4f21e2',
      '0x28d1bcfd', '0xdd6801f2',
      '0x2e1a7d4d', '0x205c2878'
    ]
  }
]

Now, to simulate the issue, lets modify the struct as below by adding a new boolean field called newFlag.
 
struct SingleUpnlSig {
    bytes reqId;
    uint256 timestamp;
    int256 upnl;
    bytes gatewaySignature;
    SchnorrSign sigs;
    **bool  newFlag;**
}

**Mapping After changing the structure**
Now, when the AccountFacet is deployed, the mapping is updated as below. The contract address remains the same, but notice the function selectors.

AccountFacet deployed: 0xDc64a140Aa3E981100a9becA4E685f962f0cF6C9
[
  {
    facetAddress: '0xDc64a140Aa3E981100a9becA4E685f962f0cF6C9',
    action: 0,
    functionSelectors: [
      '0x90ca796b', '0xcd0bac16',
      '**0x3f4788d7**', '**0x79154233**',
      '0xb6b55f25', '0xddabc862',
      '0xbeacd367', '0x2f4f21e2',
      '0x28d1bcfd', '**0xbfbb4c97**',
      '0x2e1a7d4d', '0x205c2878'
    ]
  }
]

Three function addresses have changed and this could break the interaction with contracts that knew the old address.
This is the cases only with structs, as with native types, diamond proxy patterns will not see this issue. The developers should be aware of this potential issue and should explicitly document as part of the specs to minimise the risk.

This is an easy mistake to commit from a developer''s points of view as he is adding an additional field that does not alter the memory layout of storage. But, the impact is huge and not easy to detect.

## Impact
Functionality will stop working and consumers of AccountFacet would start seeing errors like "**Diamond: Function does not exist**"

**AccountFacet Functions:**
Below are the three functions where the struct was used.

In the diamond proxy,  the address will not resolve leading to function does not exists.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/Diamond.sol#L32-L43

```solidity
fallback() external payable {
        LibDiamond.DiamondStorage storage ds;
        bytes32 position = LibDiamond.DIAMOND_STORAGE_POSITION;
        // get diamond storage
        assembly {
            ds.slot := position
        }
        // get facet from function selector
        address facet = ds.facetAddressAndSelectorPosition[msg.sig].facetAddress;
        require(facet != address(0), "Diamond: Function does not exist");
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Dont use structs as parameters to functions, instead pass each field as parameter especially for diamond proxy pattern.
This will ensure that signature does not change unintentionally and minimises the risk.
