# A PartyB manager can not remove (revoke) a PartyB's address even if the PartyB's address is a malicious address

## Summary
A PartyB manager, who has a `PARTY_B_MANAGER_ROLE`, can register an address as a `partyB` via the ControlFacet#`registerPartyB()`. 

However, there is no function (logic) for the PartyB manager to remove (revoke) the existing PartyB address. 
Therefore, once a PartyB manager registered a PartyB's address, the PartyB manager can not remove (revoke) the PartyB's address even if the PartyB's address is a malicious address.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the ControlFacet#`registerPartyB()`, a PartyB manager, who has a `PARTY_B_MANAGER_ROLE`, can register an address as a `partyB`. And then, `True` would be assigned into the `partyBStatus` storage of the address. Finally, the address would be added to the `partyBList` array storage like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/control/ControlFacet.sol#L66-L67
```solidity
    function registerPartyB(
        address partyB
    ) external onlyRole(LibAccessibility.PARTY_B_MANAGER_ROLE) {
        require(
            !MAStorage.layout().partyBStatus[partyB],
            "ControlFacet: Address is already registered"
        );
        MAStorage.layout().partyBStatus[partyB] = true; /// @audit
        MAStorage.layout().partyBList.push(partyB);  /// @audit
        emit RegisterPartyB(partyB);
    }
```

After a PartyB manager registered a PartyB address, it is supposed to be removed (revoked) by the PartyB manager if it would be revealed that the PartyB address registered is a malicious user.

However, there is no function (logic) for the PartyB manager to remove (revoke) the existing PartyB address. 
Therefore, once a PartyB manager registered a PartyB's address, the PartyB manager can not remove (revoke) the PartyB's address even if the PartyB's address is a malicious address.

## Impact
Once a PartyB manager registered a PartyB's address, the PartyB manager can not remove (revoke) the PartyB's address even if the PartyB's address is a malicious address. 

If the malicious PartyB's address can remain as a PartyB, they can keep acting with some actions (lockQuote, etc) and therefore they may be a bad influence for the PartyAs.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Within the ControlFacet contract, consider adding a function (logic) for the PartyB manager to remove (revoke) the existing PartyB address like this:
```solidity
+   function removePartyB(
+       address partyB
+   ) external onlyRole(LibAccessibility.PARTY_B_MANAGER_ROLE) {
+       require(
+           MAStorage.layout().partyBStatus[partyB],
+           "ControlFacet: Address must already be registered"
+       );
+       MAStorage.layout().partyBStatus[partyB] = false;
+       for(uint256 i=0; i < MAStorage.layout().partyBList.length; i++) {
+           if (MAStorage.layout().partyBList[i] == partyB) {
+               MAStorage.layout().partyBList[i] = MAStorage.layout().partyBList[MAStorage.layout().partyBList.length - 1];
+               MAStorage.layout().partyBList.pop();
+               break;
+           }
+       }
+
+       emit PartyBRemoved(partyB);
+   }
```
