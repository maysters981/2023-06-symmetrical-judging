# A liquidator can not liquidate the PartyA's pending quotes due to reaching the gas limit in the for-loop

## Summary
If a lot of the PartyA's pending quotes are stored into the `partyAPendingQuotes` array storage, a liquidator can not liquidate the PartyA's pending quotes due to reaching the gas limit in the for-loop.


## Vulnerability Detail

When a liquidator liquidates the PartyA's pending quotes, the LiquidationFacet#`liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA()` would be called.
Within the LiquidationFacet#`liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA()`, the LiquidationFacetImpl#`liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA()` would be called like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacet.sol#L37
```solidity
    function liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA(
        address partyA
    ) external whenNotLiquidationPaused onlyRole(LibAccessibility.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE) {
        LiquidationFacetImpl.liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA(partyA);  /// @audit
        ...
    }
```

Within the LiquidationFacetImpl#`liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA()`, each partyA's pending quote would be liquidated in the for-loop like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L105-L121
```solidity
    function liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA(address partyA) internal {
        QuoteStorage.Layout storage quoteLayout = QuoteStorage.layout();
        ...
        for (uint256 index = 0; index < quoteLayout.partyAPendingQuotes[partyA].length; index++) {  /// @audit
            Quote storage quote = quoteLayout.quotes[
                quoteLayout.partyAPendingQuotes[partyA][index]
            ];
            if (
                (quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.LOCKED ||
                    quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.CANCEL_PENDING) &&
                quoteLayout.partyBPendingQuotes[quote.partyB][partyA].length > 0
            ) {
                delete quoteLayout.partyBPendingQuotes[quote.partyB][partyA];
                AccountStorage
                .layout()
                .partyBPendingLockedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA].makeZero();
            }
            quote.quoteStatus = QuoteStatus.LIQUIDATED;
            quote.modifyTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        }
        AccountStorage.layout().pendingLockedBalances[partyA].makeZero();
        delete quoteLayout.partyAPendingQuotes[partyA];
    }
```

Within the LiquidationFacetImpl#`liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA()` above, how many number of PartyA's pending quote are looped would be determined based on the number of the PartyA's pending quotes that is assigned into the `partyAPendingQuotes` array storage (`quoteLayout.partyAPendingQuotes[partyA].length`).

However, within the LiquidationFacetImpl#`liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA()`, there is no limitation how many number of PartyA's pending quote can be looped.
If a PartyA send a lot of quotes and therefore a lot of the PartyA's pending quotes would be created and assigned into the `partyAPendingQuotes` array storage, the transaction of the LiquidationFacetImpl#`liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA()` will be reverted in the for-loop above due to reaching the gas limit when a liquidator call the LiquidationFacetImpl#`liquidatePendingPositionsPartyA()`. 

As a result, a liquidator cannot liquidate this PartyA's pending quotes.


## Impact
A liquidator can not liquidate the PartyA's pending quotes due to reaching the gas limit in the for-loop if a lot of the PartyA's pending quotes are stored into the `partyAPendingQuotes` array storage.

## Recommendation
Consider setting the limitation (cap) how many number of the pending quotes a PartyA can create (and store them into the `partyAPendingQuotes` array storage).
