# Depending on the length of the array, removeFromArray cannot be invoked.

## Summary
Loop through the array when deleting `pendingQuotes`. This may exceed the gas limit of the block depending on the length of the loop, and the function containing this process may not be able to be invoked.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `getIndexOfItem` in `LibQuote`'s `removeFromArray` function contains `for (uint256 index = 0; index < array_.length; index++)`, which may exceed the gas limit depending on the array length.
The functions that include these processes are `requestToCancelQuote`, `unlockQuote`, `expandQuote`, `forceCancelQuote`, `acceptCancelRequest`, and `openPosition`, which affect several important functions.
## Impact
Many protocol-critical functions are disabled.
