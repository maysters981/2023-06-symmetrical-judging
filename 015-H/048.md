# PartyA can create pending quotes more than the limit

## Summary
A potential loophole in the system allows for the exploitation of gas cost inefficiencies to obstruct the liquidation process. An attacker, through PartyA and PartyB, can generate an excessive number of small pending positions, bypassing the pending positions limit check when PartyB fills a fraction of a position. This scenario inflates the gas costs, causing the liquidation process to become inefficient and potentially fail, thereby rendering PartyA unliquidatable. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The current infrastructure of the system establishes a crucial constraint for the liquidation process - PartyA's pending positions  must be closed for liquidations to be executed. However, a potential vulnerability emerges when PartyA systematically generates an exorbitant number of miniscule pending positions, thereby obstructing the liquidation process due to increased gas inefficiencies.

Here's how the exploitation could be described:
PartyA initiates the process by creating a quote, then PartyB - operating under the same entity or cooperating with PartyA - proceeds to open positions at the lowest allowable amount, also known as minAcceptableQuoteValue. This sequence is repeatedly executed to inflate the number of pending positions associated with PartyA.

In the current setup, the function sendQuote is responsible for creating quotes for PartyB, and it does perform a check for the limit on pending positions. However, a loophole exists - this check is not performed when PartyB fills a fraction of a position. This leads to the creation of a new pending position which is then added to the pool of existing pending positions, regardless of whether it breaches the predefined limit.

By exploiting this loophole, an attacker can create an excessive number of minuscule pending positions. This inflates the associated gas costs for liquidation to such an extent that the liquidation process may fail due to its inefficiency. Consequently, this method could potentially render PartyA unliquidatable, leading to potential system abuse and integrity breach.
## Impact
Attacker can achieve a state where it is impossible to liquidate him because of the gas consumption in the for loop inside the liquidation.
