# Collisions may occur when PartyA and PartyB are liquidated concurrently

## Summary

PartyA can be liquidated while one of the corresponding PartyBs has been liquidated. In this case, the open quotes can only be liquidated from one side only. If a position is first liquidated in PartyB liquidation, the corresponding PartyA would never be fully liquidated and get its functionality blocked forever.

## Vulnerability Detail

When liquidation occurs, whether PartyA or PartyB, the accounted is first marked as liquidated.
Also before liquidation, the LiquidationFacet checks if the account is already marked as liquidated, to avoid liquidation on already liquidated accounts.
```solidity
    /* LiquidationFacet.sol */
    function liquidatePartyA(
        address partyA,
        SingleUpnlSig memory upnlSig
    )
    external
    whenNotLiquidationPaused
    notLiquidatedPartyA(partyA) //@audit Only Check PartyA
    onlyRole(LibAccessibility.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE)

    function liquidatePartyB(
        address partyB,
        address partyA,
        SingleUpnlSig memory upnlSig
    )
    external
    whenNotLiquidationPaused
    notLiquidatedPartyB(partyB, partyA)
    notLiquidatedPartyA(partyA)
    onlyRole(LibAccessibility.LIQUIDATOR_ROLE)
```
However, as you can see, `liquidatePartyB` checks liquidation status for both PartyA and PartyB, but `liquidatePartyA` checks only for PartyA. Therefore, it is possible that PartyB gets liquidated, then the corresponding PartyA also gets liquidated.

After the PartyB has been marked as liquidated, the liquidator has to liquidate the open positions of PartyB, which marks the quoteStatus as liquidated and then closes the quote.

```solidity
    /* LiquidationFacetImpl.sol # liquidatePositionsPartyB */
        quote.quoteStatus = QuoteStatus.LIQUIDATED;
        quote.modifyTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        ...
        LibQuote.removeFromOpenPositions(quote.id);
        quoteLayout.partyAPositionsCount[partyA] -= 1;
        quoteLayout.partyBPositionsCount[partyB][partyA] -= 1;
```

Since the quote is marked as `LIQUIDATED`, it cannot be liquidated through `liquidatePositionsPartyA` of the PartyA side.

```solidity
    /* LiquidationFacetImpl.sol # liquidatePositionsPartyA */
        require(
            quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.OPENED ||
                quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.CLOSE_PENDING ||
                quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.CANCEL_CLOSE_PENDING, //@audit IF PARTYB HAS LIQUIDATED?
            "LiquidationFacet: Invalid state"
        );
```

However, in order to fully liquidate PartyA, it is necessary to liquidate individual positions and accumulate the totalUpnl calculation, to check if the liquidation is valid.

```solidity
        // For each positions, sum up the pnl
        if (hasMadeProfit) {
            accountLayout.totalUnplForLiquidation[partyA] += int256(amount);
        } else {
            accountLayout.totalUnplForLiquidation[partyA] -= int256(amount);
        }
