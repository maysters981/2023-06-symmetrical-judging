# PartyB can achieve to be the partyB of its partyA trade

## Summary
A loophole in the code could allow a trader to avoid liquidation by effectively becoming both PartyA and PartyB for a given position. This involves creating a quote as PartyA, transitioning back to PartyB for a different trade, and then transferring allocation to their original PartyA position.
## Vulnerability Detail
While it's strictly prohibited in the Symmetrical protocol for a PartyA to simultaneously act as PartyB for their own trade, this safeguard can be circumvented. A participant operating as PartyB could establish a quote as PartyA, then transition back to their PartyB role for a different PartyA. They then transfer the allocation to their own PartyA position, effectively making themselves both PartyA and PartyB for that position. This manoeuvre undermines the core mechanics of the protocol, including the solidity code and the Muon application.

The Muon application has several checks in place to ensure that PartyA and PartyB are not the same entity, as shown in these sections of the code:

In such situations, the Muon application would be unable to generate the required signatures for specific actions. A cunning trader could exploit this vulnerability to create multiple positions, safe in the knowledge that they cannot be liquidated.

For instance, a trader might establish ten partyA/partyB positions, then allocate one of their partyB positions to their own partyA position, thereby ensuring they occupy both roles for that position.
## Impact
Since the critic Muon signatures can't be created in such cases, this should be a valid high. Users pNl can't be calculated because of the throwing error in Muon app. One of the Muon functions is needed for liquidation and user is impossible to get liquidated because the Muon signature will not be able to created.
