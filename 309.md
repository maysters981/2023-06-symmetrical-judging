# function  ```withdrawCooldownOf``` returns wrong value.

## Summary
The function  ```withdrawCooldownOf``` is supposed to return the withdraw cooldown of a particular user, however this function does not return the estimated cool down period 

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
//@audit-issue does not check the withdraw cooldown for the user, 
 function withdrawCooldownOf(address user) external view returns (uint256) {
        return AccountStorage.layout().withdrawCooldown[user];
    }
```
This because of where the mapping ```withdrawCooldown[user]``` is set, 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L156
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L68
As we can see, the withdrawCooldown is set to the exact block.timestamp of the deallocation, and where it is used, it was added to another variable to get the cooldown period
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L30-L34 
Hence the output of this function is invalid 
## Impact
Calling the function returns the deallocation timestamp not the cooldown period end of a user
## Code Snippet

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Update the function to 

```solidity
  function withdrawCooldownOf(address user) external view returns (uint256) {
        return AccountStorage.layout().withdrawCooldown[user] + MAStorage.layout().deallocateCooldown;
    }
```
