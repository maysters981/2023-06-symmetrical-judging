# `abi.encodePacked` should stop to be used since there are conversions around to deprecate it in future versions of Solidity

## Summary
In `verifyPrices()`, several dynamic arguments are passed to `abi.encodePacked()` which can cause certain issues in current/future versions as described below. It would be better for protocol to prefer `abi.encode()` just to be safe.

## Vulnerability Detail
`abi.encodePacked()` will be removed according to Solidity guide https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/issues/11593
Also it will cause vulnerability in case of future update where you add dynamic types as arguments. Described in here https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.19/abi-spec.html#non-standard-packed-mode

## Impact
`abi.encodePacked` will behaviour unexpectedly in case of future Solidity update and should not be used. It will break the MerkleProof check if you add dynamic types in leaf argument in next protocol upgrade.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `abi.encode()` or `bytes.concat()` instead of `abi.encodePacked`.
