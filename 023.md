# PartyA does not receive it's promised credit valuation adjustment (cva), when liquidations occur

## Summary
The current implementation of the code results in an inconsistency regarding the Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) when liquidations occur between partyA and partyB. While partyB receives the CVA when partyA is liquidated, the reverse is not true.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the provided documentation, it states that the CVA is the penalty that the liquidated side should pay to the other party. However, in the code snippet [LiquidationFacetImpl.sol/L166-L168](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L166-L168), when partyA is liquidated, partyB receives the promised CVA:
```jsx
accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][partyA] += quote.lockedValues.cva;
```
On the other hand, the equivalent action for partyA is [commented out](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L347):
```jsx
// accountLayout.allocatedBalances[partyA] += quote.lockedValues.cva;
```
As one of the developers (Sajad) explained in discord:
> For every line of libmuon, Please proceed under the assumption that they are not commented.
> But about the lines of code in LiquidiationFacetImpl.sol lines 347-360, they are commented.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To address the inconsistency, it is recommended to remove the comments and uncomment the following lines of code:
```jsx
accountLayout.allocatedBalances[partyA] += quote.lockedValues.cva;

accountLayout.lockedBalances[partyA].subQuote(quote);

(bool hasMadeProfit, uint256 amount) = LibQuote.getValueOfQuoteForPartyA(
    priceSig.prices[index],
    LibQuote.quoteOpenAmount(quote),
     quote
);

if (hasMadeProfit) {
     accountLayout.allocatedBalances[partyA] += amount;
} else {
      accountLayout.allocatedBalances[partyA] -= amount;
}
```
