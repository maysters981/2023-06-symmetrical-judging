# Trading fee update can be sandwiched for atomic profits

## Summary
Trading fee update can be sandwiched for atomic profits by an attacker that sends a quote before the update and immediately closes after the fee update. 
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider a scenario where the protocol decides to escalate the trading fee from 1% to 2%. An attacker, upon observing this transaction in the mempool, swiftly deposits and allocates stablecoins worth 10M (the maximum amount per the balanceLimitPerUser, which is 10M in this situation). Following this, the attacker formulates a quote with a locked total value of 10M, obligating the attacker to pay a trading fee of 100K (1% of 10M).

Subsequently, right after the trading fee update transaction, the attacker triggers the requestToCancelQuote function. This action leads to the return of the trading fee to the attacker. However, as the trading fee has been updated to 2%, the returned amount is now 200K (2% of 10M), along with the initial 10M deposited by the attacker. In this manner, the attacker exploits the trading fee update to secure an instantaneous profit of 100K.
## Impact
Since this can make considerable amount of funds to be lost, I'll label it as high.
