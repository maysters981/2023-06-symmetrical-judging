# Maintaince margin is ignored when account is in a big overall loss

## Summary

Maintaince margin (`mm` in the code) is ignored in all calculations throughout the code, when account is in a loss higher than overall maintaince margin. This leads to weaker protection against quick price moves both for partyA and partyB and possible loss of funds due to bad debt.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol uses maintaince margin (`mm`) as a risk protection measure against opening large positions with low allocated funds. However, maintaince margin is only applied when account unrealized pnl is positive (account is in a profit). If the account is in large loss (higher than `mm`), then `mm` is ignored, allowing to open positions (and deallocate) based on `cva` and `lf` values only.

For example, 

1. If account has allocated balance of `100`, current locked `mm = 100` (consider `cva` = `lf` = 0 for simplicity) and unrealized profit of `50` (total available funds = `150`), it can unallocate max `50` (remaining available funds = `100`).

2. If account has allocated balance of `250`, current locked `mm = 100` and unrealized loss of `-100` (total available funds = `150`), it can unallocate max `150` (remaining available funds = `0`), which is a much riskier position, which can easily go into bad debt and a loss of profit for the other party.

Both cases (`balance = 100`, `upnl = 50` vs `balance = 250`, `upnl = -100`) are exactly the same from risk standpoint (it doesn't matter what the original balance was - what matters is that if position is closed right now, balance will be `150` in both cases), however the 2nd case (unrealized loss) is much riskier for the other party for no reason.

The same logic is also present in the following code:

## Impact

Malicious partyA can intentionally put its account into large loss (there are a lot of ways to achieve it: open 2 different direction positions of the same size, one of them will be in a big loss while the other one in the same profit when price deviates from initial price; use partyB which is owned by the same user, to open position which is immediately in a large loss; etc). After that all positions opened by this partyA will ignore `mm`, so it can open risky positions with high risk of creating bad debt and a loss of funds for the other party of the trade.

## Code Snippet

Add this to any test, for example to `ClosePosition.behavior.ts`. It demonstrates that partyA can unallocate so that remaining funds are just $11 and still have positions opened with `mm = 500`.

```ts
  it("Ignore maintaince margin", async function () {
    const context: RunContext = this.context;

    this.user_allocated = decimal(1000);
    this.hedger_allocated = decimal(2000);

    this.user = new User(this.context, this.context.signers.user);
    await this.user.setup();
    await this.user.setBalances(this.user_allocated, this.user_allocated, this.user_allocated);

    this.hedger = new Hedger(this.context, this.context.signers.hedger);
    await this.hedger.setup();
    await this.hedger.setBalances(this.hedger_allocated, this.hedger_allocated);

    this.liquidator = new User(this.context, this.context.signers.liquidator);
    await this.liquidator.setup();

    await this.user.sendQuote(limitQuoteRequestBuilder().quantity(decimal(1000))
      .cva(decimal(1)).lf(decimal(10)).mm(decimal(500))
      .upnlSig(getDummySingleUpnlAndPriceSig(decimal(1), decimal(0))).build());
    await this.hedger.lockQuote(1);
    await this.hedger.openPosition(1, limitOpenRequestBuilder().filledAmount(decimal(1000)).build());

    var info = await this.user.getBalanceInfo();
    console.log("Allocated balance: " + info.allocatedBalances/1e18 + 
      " Locked: " + info.totalLocked / 1e18 + 
      " Locked mm: " + info.lockedMm / 1e18 + 
      " Locked cva+lf: "+(info.lockedCva.add(info.lockedLf))/1e18);

    console.log("With a loss of -900, deallocate 79");
    await context.accountFacet.connect(this.user.signer).deallocate(decimal(79), await getDummySingleUpnlSig(decimal(-900)));

    info = await this.user.getBalanceInfo();
    console.log("Allocated balance: " + info.allocatedBalances/1e18 + 
      " upnl: -900 remaining: " + (info.allocatedBalances/1e18 - 900) +
      " Locked: " + info.totalLocked / 1e18 + 
      " Locked mm: " + info.lockedMm / 1e18 + 
      " Locked cva+lf: "+(info.lockedCva.add(info.lockedLf))/1e18);
    
  });
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

There is absolutely no reason to have different formula for unrealized profit and unrealized loss. Simply remove this difference and make the same formula for remaining funds regardless of profit or loss as:

`remainingAmount = allocatedAmount + upnl - lockedBalances.total()`

On a side but related note, your terms usage is different from industry standard, which is `initial margin` (margin required to open position or withdaw funds) and maintaince margin (margin required to keep position running, otherwise it gets liquidated). In your case, `cva + lf` is what `maintaince margin` is in the industry, and `cva +lf + mm` is what `initial margin` is in the industry, so your `mm` (maintaince margin) is slightly misleading term, because it's actually initial margin (used only for opening new positions and deallocations). I suggest you to re-think the terms usage to be more in-line with usual terms used.
