# Users could deposit and allocate (for partyB) even when their subaccount is flagged for liquidation

## Summary
Users could deposit and allocate (for partyB) even when their subaccount is flagged for liquidation.
## Vulnerability Detail
Users should not be able to allocate/decallocate balance when their subaccount is flagged for liquidation. However, function depositAndAllocateForPartyB does not have liquidation status check of partyB, so users could use this function even when their subaccount is marked to be liquidated.
## Impact

Any other allocate/ deallocate functions has liquidation check. While it does not cause any real harm for now, it's better to fix it to prevent future inconsistencies.
