# Rounding error when dividing liquidation fee

## Summary

Some amount of assets will be stuck in the contracts due to rounding errors.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L221

```solidity
File: LiquidationFacetImpl.sol
126:     function liquidatePositionsPartyA(
127:         address partyA,
128:         uint256[] memory quoteIds
129:     ) internal returns (bool) {
..SNIP..
220:             if (lf > 0) {
221:                 accountLayout.allocatedBalances[accountLayout.liquidators[partyA][0]] += lf / 2;
222:                 accountLayout.allocatedBalances[accountLayout.liquidators[partyA][1]] += lf / 2;
223:             }
```

At the end of the liquidation process for PartyA, the liquidation fee will be split into two and they are added to the balance of the liquidator(s) who triggered the `setSymbolsPrice` and `liquidatePositionsPartyA` functions.

If the liquidation fee (LF) is an odd value, dividing it by two will cause a round down. 

Assume that the LF is 9, then 9/2 = 4. 1 will be stuck in the contract.

## Impact

Some assets will be stuck in the contracts.

## Recommendation

Consider sweeping the remaining amount to the last recipient as shown below.

```solidity
if (lf > 0) {
	uint payout = lf / 2
    accountLayout.allocatedBalances[accountLayout.liquidators[partyA][0]] += payout
    accountLayout.allocatedBalances[accountLayout.liquidators[partyA][1]] += (lf - payout)
} 
```
