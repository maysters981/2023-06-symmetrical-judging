# Some actions are allowed on partyB when corresponding partyA is liquidated allowing to steal all protocol funds

## Summary

`deallocateForPartyB` function doesn't check if partyA is liquidated, allowing partyB to deallocate funds when partyA liquidation process is not finished:

`transferAllocation` function doesn't check if partyA is liquidated either:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L71-L106

Either of these functions allows to deallocate (or transfer, then deallocate) funds for partyB when partyA liquidation is not yet finished. Coupled with the ability for liquidator to choose which partyA positions to liquidate, this allows to steal all protocol funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

Liquidating partyA is a multi-step process. First, `liquidatePartyA` is called to mark the start of liquidation process. Then, liquidator has to set symbol prices, liquidate pending quotes and finally call `liquidatePositionsPartyA` (possibly multiple times) with liquidated positions. Each position, which is liquidated in the `liquidatePositionsPartyA` function increases `allocatedBalance` of partyB if the position is in a loss for partyA (profit for partyB).

The bug reported here allows for partyB to deallocate this increased `allocatedBalance` while partyA liquidation is still in process. The scenario to exploit this bug is as following:

1. User has to control partyA, partyB and liquidator.
2. Open 2 large opposite positions between partyA and partyB such that one of them is in a high loss and the other in the same/similar profit (easy to do via  openPrice which is far away from current market price, since both partyA and partyB are controlled by the same user).
3. Make partyA liquidatable (many ways to do this: for example, opposite positions can have slightly different size with minimal locked balances, so that when the price moves, this disparency can make partyA liquidatable)
4. Call `liquidatePartyA` and `setSymbolsPrice` (there is no bad debt, because 1 position is in a big loss, the other position in a big profit, but their sum is in a small loss, which is covered by allocatd balance)
5. Sign `singleUpnlSig` for partyB at this time (partyB is in a small profit)
6. User-controlled liquidator calls `liquidatePositionsPartyA` with id of only the position which is in a loss for partyA, profit for partyB. This call increases partyB allocated balance by a very high profit of the position. Moreover, this action doesn't change partyB's nonce, so previous partyB signature is still valid.
7. At this time partyB has large inflated allocatedBalance and the same big loss, however signature for when partyB was in a small profit is still valid, because party B nonce is the same (position liquidation didn't change it). Use that older signature to sign `deallocateForPartyB`, deallocating inflated balance (which can easily be higher than total protocol deposited funds).
8. Withdraw deallocated balance for partyB. At this point all protocol funds are stolen.

The other instances where there is no check if party is liquidated:

1. partyA `requestToClosePosition` (it checks if quote is liquidated, but doesn't check for neither partyA nor partyB liquidation status)
2. partyB `fillCloseRequest` (same as `requestToClosePosition`)
3. partyA `deallocate` checks for partyA liquidation status, but can't check for partyB liquidation status, because there can be multiple partyB's. This is reported as a separate bug, because the core problem (muon app signing incorrect upnl) and solution for that one is different.

## Impact

All protocol funds can be stolen if a user can control partyA, partyB and liquidator. Since partyB and liquidator roles are supposed to be easy to get, this means that most users are able to easily steal all protocol funds.

## Code Snippet

Add this to any test, for example to `ClosePosition.behavior.ts`.

```ts
import { getDummyPriceSig, getDummySingleUpnlAndPriceSig, getDummyQuotesPriceSig, getDummySingleUpnlSig } from "./utils/SignatureUtils";

  await this.user2.setup();
  await this.user2.setBalances(this.protocol_allocated, this.protocol_allocated, 0);

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add require's (or modifiers) to check that neither partyA nor partyB of the quote are liquidated in the following functions:
1. `deallocateForPartyB`
2. `transferAllocation`
3. `requestToClosePosition`
4. `fillCloseRequest`
