# Access Control: Other users can force close a suspended users position.

## Summary
Malicious users are suspended from participation in the protocol through setSuspendedAddress(). The modifier `notSuspended(address user)` is used to check if a user has been suspended. Although this modifier can be used to prevent malicious users from performing actions on their own accounts, it does not stop other users from performing actions on the behalf of the suspended user. So we must check that partyA is not a suspended account so users do not force close suspended account positions. 

## Vulnerability Detail

If a user is suspended and they have pending close requests, other users are able to force close their positions on their behalf. Suspended account positions should not be force closed under any circumstance. 

## Impact

Other users will be able to force close pending suspended account positions. The impact of this issue is that suspended users will indirectly have access to functions they should not have access to (via non-suspended users acting on their behalf).

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It order to mitigate this, we must check that partyA for the quote ID in question is not a suspended account. This can be achieved by utilising the function `isSuspended` declared in `ViewFacet.sol`

```solidity
 function forceClosePosition(uint256 quoteId, PairUpnlAndPriceSig memory upnlSig)
        external
        notLiquidated(quoteId)
        whenNotPartyAActionsPaused
    {
        Quote storage quote = QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId];
        
        if (isSuspended(quote.partyA){
          revert("Cannot force close suspended users position");
        }
        uint256 filledAmount = quote.quantityToClose;
        uint256 requestedClosePrice = quote.requestedClosePrice;
        PartyAFacetImpl.forceClosePosition(quoteId, upnlSig);
        emit ForceClosePosition(
            quoteId,
            quote.partyA,
            quote.partyB,
            filledAmount,
            requestedClosePrice,
            quote.quoteStatus
        );
    }
}
```
