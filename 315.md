# Missing modifiers on functions in AccountFacet

## Summary
There are missing modifiers in the functions of AccountFacet contract, that enable users to interact with them even when their functionality is paused.

## Vulnerability Detail
partyB functions such as depositForPartyB, and allocateForPartyB use the modifierwhenNotPartyBActionsPaused, which pauses their functionality when partyB actions are paused. It's expected that partyA's functions like deposit and allocate would have whenNotPartyAActionsPaused. But, they don't have the modifier.

Similarly, whenNotAccountingPaused is not used for partyB functions like allocateForPartyB, depositForPartyB.

## Impact
Not using the right modifiers would allow users to keep interacting with these functions even when their functionality is supposed to be paused.

## Code Snippet
In [AccountFacet](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol#L13C1-L13C1), the functions: [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol#L16), [allocate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol#L39), [allocateForPartyB](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol#L66), [depositForPartyB](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol#L93).
