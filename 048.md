# `diamondCut()` doesn't validate `_init` and `_calldata`

## Summary
Malicious or compromised admins can send any `_init` and `_calldata` at their will. This is dangerous as they will be used for a `delegatecall` operation.  An attacker can execute a `delegatecall` to steal funds or `selfdestruct` the system.

## Vulnerability Detail
- Malicious can create an empty payload for _init and _calldata.
- Then the malicious executes the update with _init pointing to a malicious contract, stealing funds from the system.

## Impact
Diamonds will be upgraded by admin. Malicious or compromised admins can exploit the contract in any way of their choice.
