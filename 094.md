# Deallocation of funds blocks funds that were not allocated.

## Summary
Deallocation of funds blocks funds that were not allocated.
## Vulnerability Detail
When user deposits funds then this funds are [stored to his balance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L24).
If he wants to trade with some amount of funds, then user [should allocate them](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L50-L51). Also user can deallocate his allocated funds if he don't want to trade with them anymore. When he does that, [then timestamp is set](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L68) that marks deallocation time.

When user wants to withdraw then [there is a check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L30-L34) that cooldown has passed since last deallocating.

Because of that users funds that were not allocated before are blocked as well.
Example.
1.User deposited 1000$.
2.User allocated 100$.
3.User deallocated 100$
4.User can't withdraw all balance. But only 100$ should be blocked.
## Impact
All balance of user is blocked.
