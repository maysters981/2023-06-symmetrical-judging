# Wrong accounting happens when opening a partially filled position, which leads to permanent loss of funds.

## Summary
Wrong accounting happens when opening a partially filled position, which leads to permanent loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The process of opening a position is simple, if the order is MARKET the user will need to provide the full amount of the Quote quantity in order to open the position. On the other hand if the order is LIMIT, the user can provide an amount they want up to the full quantity of the Quote. 

Depending on the circumstances, when a LIMIT order is partially filled. The function can create a new PENDING Quote with the leftover locked values.

The issue occurs, when a order is partially filled and a new pending Quote is issued.

The else statement below is triggered when the newStatus of the Quote is PENDING, the function subtracts the filledLockedValues from the pendingLockedBalances, but makes the huge mistake to do the same for the partyBPendingLockedBalances.

The new Quote created is PENDING and PartyB is reset to the zero address. 

As a result the old Party B no longer needs to hold the leftover locked values in his partyBPendingLockedBalances.
This logic error is permanent and can't be fixed as the new Quote with the leftover locked values is PENDING.
Party B can't do nothing in order to get rid of the wrongly accounted leftover locked values in his partyBPendingLockedBalances mapping.

Duo to the wrong accounting of the partyBPendingLockedbalances, this logic error leads to permanent loss of funds.
As PartyB won't be able to deallocate his full balance of funds in order to withdraw them.

## Impact
Partially filling an order leads to the wrong accounting of PartyB balances, when new pending Quote is issued.
On the other hand this wrong accounting leads to permanent loss of funds as Party B won't be able to deallocate his full balance of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
When creating a new pending Quote, the whole old quote values should be subtracted from partyBPendingLockedBalances. As PartyB doesn't need to hold the leftover locked values for the new PENDING Quote.

```solidity
            if (newStatus == QuoteStatus.CANCELED) {
                // send trading Fee back to partyA
                LibQuote.returnTradingFee(currentId);
                // part of quote has been filled and part of it has been canceled
                accountLayout.pendingLockedBalances[quote.partyA].subQuote(quote);
                accountLayout.partyBPendingLockedBalances[quote.partyB][quote.partyA].subQuote(
                    quote
                );
            } else {
                accountLayout.pendingLockedBalances[quote.partyA].sub(filledLockedValues);
                accountLayout.partyBPendingLockedBalances[quote.partyB][quote.partyA].sub(
                   quote
                );
            }
```
