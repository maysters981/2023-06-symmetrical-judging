# Incorrect accounting in openPosition partially fill logic

## Summary
The entire quote value is deducted from lockedBalances and partyBLockedBalances when the quote is only being partially filled.

## Vulnerability Detail
In PartBFacetImpl `openPosition()` when a quote is being partially filled and newStatus != QuoteStatus.CANCELED the filledLockedValues are deducted from pendingLockedBalances and partyBPendingLockedBalances but later the entire quote value is added to lockedBalances and partyBLockedBalances, allowing a quote to be opened without being fully backed by the locked values of A and B. The locked values equivalent to quote.quantity - filledLockedValues have not been accounted for in the subtraction from pending locked balances and so are unbacked when the position is opened.

## Impact
Party A and B receive a partial return of their locked balances and a position is opened with only  part of what should be the locked balances allocated towards it, allowing both parties to partially enter into the position at no cost. 

## Code Snippet
`
if (newStatus == QuoteStatus.CANCELED) {
                // send trading Fee back to partyA
                LibQuote.returnTradingFee(currentId);
                accountLayout.pendingLockedBalances[quote.partyA].subQuote(quote);
                accountLayout.partyBPendingLockedBalances[quote.partyB][quote.partyA].subQuote(
                    quote
                );
            } else {
// @audit filledLockedValues are subtracted
                accountLayout.pendingLockedBalances[quote.partyA].sub(filledLockedValues);
                accountLayout.partyBPendingLockedBalances[quote.partyB][quote.partyA].sub(
                    filledLockedValues
                );
            }
            newQuote.lockedValues = quote.lockedValues.sub(filledLockedValues);
            newQuote.initialLockedValues = newQuote.lockedValues;
            quote.quantity = filledAmount;
            quote.lockedValues = appliedFilledLockedValues;

            // lock with amount of filledAmount
// @audit entire quote.quantity is added to locked balances
            accountLayout.lockedBalances[quote.partyA].addQuote(quote);
            accountLayout.partyBLockedBalances[quote.partyB][quote.partyA].addQuote(quote);`


## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
For all cases when the quote is partially filled (including when newStatus == QuoteStatus.CANCELED) pendingLockedBalances and partyBPendingLockedBalances should have the value filledLockedValues deducted; lockedBalances, partyBLockedBalances should be increased by filledLockedValues to maintain proper accounting.
