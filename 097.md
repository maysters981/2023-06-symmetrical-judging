# User pays fees on his provided price, not accepted price

## Summary
User pays fees on his provided price, not accepted price. Because of that he overpays or underpays depending on partyB clearing price.
## Vulnerability Detail
When user creates quote, then he [pays trading fees](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L119). Amount that should be paid is calculated [inside `LibQuote.getTradingFee` function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibQuote.sol#L144).

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibQuote.sol#L122-L133
```soldity
    function getTradingFee(uint256 quoteId) internal view returns (uint256 fee) {
        QuoteStorage.Layout storage quoteLayout = QuoteStorage.layout();
        Quote storage quote = quoteLayout.quotes[quoteId];
        Symbol storage symbol = SymbolStorage.layout().symbols[quote.symbolId];
        if (quote.orderType == OrderType.LIMIT) {
            fee =
                (LibQuote.quoteOpenAmount(quote) * quote.requestedOpenPrice * symbol.tradingFee) /
                1e36;
        } else {
            fee = (LibQuote.quoteOpenAmount(quote) * quote.marketPrice * symbol.tradingFee) / 1e36;
        }
    }
```

As you can see `quote.requestedOpenPrice` is used for Limit orders and `quote.marketPrice` is used for Market order.
This prices are set by user, [when he creates quote](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L48).  

But partyB can open position for this quote [with different price](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L136-L146). 
As result this means that user should actually pay fees for the position, when position was created, using its accepted price.

Let's check example.
1.User wants to open long position with quantity 1 and price 1000$. Trading fee for symbol is 1%. So user pays 10$ as fee.
2.partyB blocks and opens position for this quote with price 950$. So fee should be 9.5$.
3.User overpaid 0.5$ in fees
## Impact
User or protocol losses portion of funds.
