# Redundant profit/loss check in close position

## Summary
When PartyA (Alice) proposes to close a trading position, she submits her desired closing price. If PartyB (Bob) agrees, an additional Profit/Loss (PNL) check happens within the system if the desired close price isn't the same as the current market price. This additional check seems redundant since a system component, the Muon oracle, already considers the current market price to calculate PNL for both parties.
## Vulnerability Detail
Whenever PartyA decides to close a position, they specify a desired closing price. If PartyB agrees to close the position and the requested closing price is different from the current market price, an extra profit/loss (PNL) check is executed within the code. However, this additional step seems unnecessary, given the Muon oracle already assesses the PNL for both parties using the current market price.

Let's illustrate this with an example: Alice, holding a (quantity 1) LONG Ethereum (ETH) position, intends to exit the trade when ETH reaches a price of $2000. The prevailing market price, though, is $1800. Alice goes ahead and sends a close request to Bob, her counterparty for this trade.

Fast forward to when Bob agrees to close the position, and the market price of ETH has risen to $2010. As part of the closing process, the 'fillCloseRequest' function triggers the 'LibSolvency.isSolventAfterClosePosition'.

        uint256 unlockedAmount = (filledAmount * (quote.lockedValues.cva + quote.lockedValues.lf)) /
            LibQuote.quoteOpenAmount(quote);

        int256 partyBAvailableBalance = LibAccount.partyBAvailableBalanceForLiquidation(
            upnlSig.upnlPartyB,
            quote.partyB,
            quote.partyA
        ) + int256(unlockedAmount);

        int256 partyAAvailableBalance = LibAccount.partyAAvailableBalanceForLiquidation(
            upnlSig.upnlPartyA,
            quote.partyA
        ) + int256(unlockedAmount);

        require(
            partyBAvailableBalance >= 0 && partyAAvailableBalance >= 0,
            "LibSolvency: Available balance is lower than zero"
        );
        if (quote.positionType == PositionType.LONG) {
            if (closedPrice >= upnlSig.price) {
                require(
                    uint256(partyBAvailableBalance) >=
                        ((filledAmount * (closedPrice - upnlSig.price)) / 1e18),
                    "LibSolvency: PartyB will be liquidatable"
                );
            } else {
                require(
                    uint256(partyAAvailableBalance) >=
                        ((filledAmount * (upnlSig.price - closedPrice)) / 1e18),
                    "LibSolvency: PartyA will be liquidatable"
                );
            }
        } else if (quote.positionType == PositionType.SHORT) {
            if (closedPrice <= upnlSig.price) {
                require(
                    uint256(partyBAvailableBalance) >=
                        ((filledAmount * (upnlSig.price - closedPrice)) / 1e18),
                    "LibSolvency: PartyB will be liquidatable"
                );
            } else {
                require(
                    uint256(partyAAvailableBalance) >=
                        ((filledAmount * (closedPrice - upnlSig.price)) / 1e18),
                    "LibSolvency: PartyA will be liquidatable"
                );
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
```

From the code snippet above, we can see the process begins by calculating the available balances factoring in the PNL. Notably, the PNL passed to the LibAccount functions is based on the prevailing market price, not Alice's requested close price.

With a quantity of 1, the current ETH price is $2010, and the open price was $1800. This gives Alice a PNL of (2010-1800) * 1 = 210.

Assume Bob's total cva+lf is 180 and mm is 219. Calculating Bob's total locked balances, we get 399 - 180 - 210 = 9. As Bob's balance of 9 is greater than zero, he is not in danger of liquidation.

The PNL calculation used the current price of $2010, not Alice's requested close price of $2000. Continuing down the code, an 'if' condition is executed. Since $2010 is greater than $2000 and Alice's position is LONG, we trigger the following statement:

require(9 >= 1 * (2010-2000))
require(9 >= 10)

Consequently, the transaction would fail. Even though Bob's PNL was based on the current price, an additional check incorporates another price factor, which has already been covered in the Muon oracles' pnl argument. 

## Impact
Double counting the extra pnl, unintended and not consistent with the design
