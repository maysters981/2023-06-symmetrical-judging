# A partyB can Dos partyA's call to forceClose

## Summary
A partyB can Dos partyA's force close, by incrementing its own nonce through dust close fills

## Vulnerability Detail
We can see that forceClose for partyA relies on a nonced signature (with nonce `accountStorage.layout().partyBNonces[partyB][partyA]`), which is fetched directly from the on-chain value:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibMuon.sol#L161-L190

However a partyB can increment this nonce by making partial filling for close for a dust amount:

Since there is no minimum boundary for the `filledAmount` parameter, partyB can use a few wei to just increment the nonce, and prevent partyA from forceClosing the quote:

## Impact
partyB can prevent partyA's force closing of a quote, and leaves potential profit for partyA unclaimable.

## Recommendation
Disable partial fill close for partyB when condition
