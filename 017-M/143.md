# Users will be able to open a position with leverage lower than one

## Summary
In this `require` on [sendQuote()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol#L50-L53)

```solidity
        require(
            lockedValues.total() <= notionalValue,
            "PartyAFacet: Leverage can't be lower than one"
        );
```
so the leverage should not be lower than one

## Vulnerability Detail
in case PartyA invokes `sendQuote()`, 
With these values:
- `quantity` = 1 weth
- `price` = $1500
 the order type is `LIMIT` and the position type is `SHORT`, and ` lockedValues.total() == notionalValue` 
so the `notionalValue` and `lockedValues.total()` will be  `$1500`

PartyB will lock the quote and invoke [openPosition()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L112-L167) with 
- `filledAmount` = 1 weth
- `openedPrice` = $1550

Now this part will get execute 

```solidity
        if (quote.quantity == filledAmount) {
            accountLayout.pendingLockedBalances[quote.partyA].subQuote(quote);
            accountLayout.partyBPendingLockedBalances[quote.partyB][quote.partyA].subQuote(quote);

            if (quote.orderType == OrderType.LIMIT) {
                quote.lockedValues.mul(openedPrice).div(quote.requestedOpenPrice);
            }
            accountLayout.lockedBalances[quote.partyA].addQuote(quote);
            accountLayout.partyBLockedBalances[quote.partyB][quote.partyA].addQuote(quote);
        }
```

let's calculate this line

```solidity
quote.lockedValues.mul(openedPrice).div(quote.requestedOpenPrice);
```

From above `lockedValues.total() == $1500 `
(1500 * 1550) / 1500 = $1550

Now users will lock $1550 whit an increase of $50 above the `filledAmount`
in case PartyA allocation is only $1500 
the `lockedBalances[ ]` will be updated with $50 as a bonus 
and if he closes this position immediately this $50 will be in his pocket.

Malicious has owned both parties A and B can choose a non-volatility market to play with it. the only thing should worry about it is this $50 should be greater than the trading fee.

## Impact
- Users will be able to open a position with leverage lower than one 
- Users are getting free money

Check the leverage and add logic to work with `SHORT`
