# Quote value can be less than minAcceptableQuoteValue

## Summary

Quote value can be less than minAcceptableQuoteValue.

## Vulnerability Detail

Every time Party A sends a quote, the [lockedValues](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibLockedValues.sol#L10-L14) of the quote is checked to ensure its valus is no less than quote symbol's [minAcceptableQuoteValue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/storages/SymbolStorage.sol#L11).
```solidity
        require(
            lockedValues.total() >= symbolLayout.symbols[symbolId].minAcceptableQuoteValue,
            "PartyAFacet: Quote value is low"
        );
```
When quote is being opened, quote's lockedValues will be adjusted if **quote.quantity == filledAmount** and **quote.orderType == OrderType.LIMIT**.

```solidity
                quote.lockedValues.mul(openedPrice).div(quote.requestedOpenPrice);
```
However, quote's lockedValues is not checked against **minAcceptableQuoteValue** any more, this is risky as quote's lockedValues can be less than **minAcceptableQuoteValue** at this time.
If it is in this case, quote will be opened with quote value being less than **minAcceptableQuoteValue**.

## Impact

Quote is opened with its value less than **minAcceptableQuoteValue**.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this vulnerability, consider checking quote's lockedValues against **minAcceptableQuoteValue** when quote being opened.
