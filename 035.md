# Access Control: PartyB can open pending quotes for suspended users.

## Summary
A suspended user who has pending quotes that have not been allocated or locked can have their positions opened by PartyB.

## Vulnerability Detail

Suspended users should not be able to participate in the market while their account is suspended. If at the time of suspension, the user has  quotes that have not been opened, partyB can lock, allocate and open quotes for the suspended user. 

The functions `openPosition`, `lockAndOpenQuote` and `allocateAndLockAndOpenQuote` are all function that will open a quote ID where partyA may be a suspended user. 

## Impact

The impact of this issue is that it gives a suspended account in-direct access to a function of the protocol they should not have access to while their account has been suspended. (i.e the ability to enter the market by opening a position)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure pending quotes are not opened by partyB if partyA is a suspended user. 
This can be achieved with the use of the function `isSuspended` declared in `ViewFacet.sol` We place this condition inside the common function `openPosition` in `PartyBFacetImpl.sol`

```solidity

function openPosition(
        uint256 quoteId,
        uint256 filledAmount,
        uint256 openedPrice,
        PairUpnlAndPriceSig memory upnlSig
    ) internal returns (uint256 currentId) {
        QuoteStorage.Layout storage quoteLayout = QuoteStorage.layout();
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        
                   if(isSuspended(quote.partyA){
       revert("Cannot fill close request for suspended user");

      }

        Quote storage quote = quoteLayout.quotes[quoteId];
        require(
            quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.LOCKED ||
            quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.CANCEL_PENDING,
            "PartyBFacet: Invalid state"
        );
        require(block.timestamp <= quote.deadline, "PartyBFacet: Quote is expired");



```
