# Access Control: Suspended users can request for their positions to be closed by PartyB

## Summary
Malicious users are suspended from participation in the protocol through `setSuspendedAddress()`. The modifier `notSuspended(address user)` is used to check if a user has been suspended.

## Vulnerability Detail

If a user has been suspended, their positions can be closed through partyB `fillCloseRequest()`. This is because the suspended user is still able to request to close their position via `requestToClosePosition` in `PartyAFacet.sol` 

## Impact
The user will be able to manipulate partyB into closing their position by calling requestToClosePosition on their suspended account. The impact of this is that it gives a suspended user access to `requestToClosePosition` which they should not be able to call while suspended.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the modifier `notSuspended(address user)` to `requestToClosePosition` to ensure suspended users cannot request to close their positions. 

```solidity

    function requestToClosePosition(
        uint256 quoteId,
        uint256 closePrice,
        uint256 quantityToClose,
        OrderType orderType,
        uint256 deadline,
        SingleUpnlAndPriceSig memory upnlSig
    ) external whenNotPartyAActionsPaused onlyPartyAOfQuote(quoteId)  notSuspended(msg.sender) notLiquidated(quoteId) {
        PartyAFacetImpl.requestToClosePosition(
            quoteId,
            closePrice,
            quantityToClose,
            orderType,
            deadline,
            upnlSig
        );
        Quote storage quote = QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId];
        emit RequestToClosePosition(
            quote.partyA,
            quote.partyB,
            quoteId,
            closePrice,
            quantityToClose,
            orderType,
            deadline,
            QuoteStatus.CLOSE_PENDING
        );
    }

```
