# Force closing a position won't work when the order type is MARKET.

## Summary
Force closing a position won't work when the order type is MARKET.

## Vulnerability Detail
Duo to the require statement applied, force closing a position is only possible if the order type is LIMIT, which shouldn't be like this.

The difference between LIMIT and MARKET orders when closing a position. Is that the MARKET order requires that the whole quantity of the Quote is being closed, while the LIMIT can be partially closed.

Generally there shouldn't be restrictions regarding MARKET orders when force closing a position, which means that this is a bug in the protocol design.

## Impact
Force closing a position won't work when the order type is MARKET.

## Recommendation
Consider removing the require statement, as both LIMIT and MARKET orders should be permitted to be force closed as a position.
