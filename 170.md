# A user, who is blacklisted by USDC token contract, can bypass the restriction of USDC token by using their another address (account) and AccountFacet#`transferAllocation()` function

## Summary
[USDC token contract has a blacklist that is operated by Circle](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/08/circle-confirms-freezing-100k-in-usdc-at-law-enforcements-request/). Once some address would be blacklisted by the USDC token contract, the address can not send (transfer) their USDC.

On the Symmetrical, USDC and USDT would be used as a collateral to deposit.

However, within both the AccountFacet#`transferAllocation()`and the AccountFacetImpl#`transferAllocation()`, there is no input validation to check whether or not both addresses (`origin` and `recipient`) would be a blacklisted-address by USDC contract. 

This allow a blacklisted-user by USDC token contract to utilize the AccountFacet#`transferAllocation()` in order to bypass the restriction by the USDC contract. Because, although the blacklisted-address can not transfer USDC, the account of the same address on the Symmetrical protocol can still transfer USDC to another account (address) in the form of allocation via the AccountFacet#`transferAllocation()` .
And therefore, a user can transfer the amount from their blacklisted address to their another non-blacklisted address via the AccountFacet#`transferAllocation()` on the Symmetrical protocol and then they can withdraw USDC from the account of non-blacklisted address.


## Vulnerability Detail
When a user (PartyA) deposit the designated-token (USDC or USDT) as a collateral, the AccountFacet#`deposit()` would be called like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol#L16-L19
```solidity
    //Party A
    function deposit(uint256 amount) external whenNotAccountingPaused {
        AccountFacetImpl.deposit(msg.sender, amount); 
        ...
    }
```

Once the user (PartyA) deposit the designated-token (USDC or USDT) as a collateral, the user (PartyA) allocate the deposited-amount in order to enable to trade like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol#L39-L44
```solidity
    function allocate(
        uint256 amount
    ) external whenNotAccountingPaused notLiquidatedPartyA(msg.sender) {
        AccountFacetImpl.allocate(amount);
        ...
    }
```

Once a user (PartyA) allocate the deposited-amount, the user (PartyA) can do some actions like below:  
- Send a quote
- Transfer allocations 
etc...

If a user (PartyA) transfer allocations, the AccountFacet#`transferAllocation()` would be called.
Within the AccountFacet#`transferAllocation()`, a user (PartyA) can send the allocated-amount from the `origin` address to the `recipient` address in the form of allocation via the AccountFacetImpl#`transferAllocation()` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacet.sol#L98-L106
```solidity

    function transferAllocation(
        uint256 amount,
        address origin,
        address recipient,
        SingleUpnlSig memory upnlSig
    ) external whenNotPartyBActionsPaused {
        AccountFacetImpl.transferAllocation(amount, origin, recipient, upnlSig);  /// @audit
        ...
    }
```

Within the AccountFacetImpl#`transferAllocation()`, the detail operation of transferring allocations would be executed like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L71-L106
```solidity
    function transferAllocation(
        uint256 amount,
        address origin,
        address recipient,
        SingleUpnlSig memory upnlSig
    ) internal {
        MAStorage.Layout storage maLayout = MAStorage.layout();
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        require(
            !maLayout.partyBLiquidationStatus[msg.sender][origin],
            "PartyBFacet: PartyB isn't solvent"
        );
        require(
            !maLayout.partyBLiquidationStatus[msg.sender][recipient],
            "PartyBFacet: PartyB isn't solvent"
        );
        // deallocate from origin
        require(
            accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[msg.sender][origin] >= amount,
            "PartyBFacet: Insufficient locked balance"
        );
        LibMuon.verifyPartyBUpnl(upnlSig, msg.sender, origin);
        int256 availableBalance = LibAccount.partyBAvailableForQuote(
            upnlSig.upnl,
            msg.sender,
            origin
        );
        require(availableBalance >= 0, "PartyBFacet: Available balance is lower than zero");
        require(uint256(availableBalance) >= amount, "PartyBFacet: Will be liquidatable");

        accountLayout.partyBNonces[msg.sender][origin] += 1;
        accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[msg.sender][origin] -= amount;
        // allocate for recipient
        accountLayout.partyBNonces[msg.sender][recipient] += 1;
        accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[msg.sender][recipient] += amount;
    }
```

According to [Q&A from README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical#q-which-erc20-tokens-do-you-expect-will-interact-with-the-smart-contracts), USDT or USDC would be used to deposit like this:
> _Q: Which ERC20 tokens do you expect will interact with the smart contracts?_
> _USDT and USDC_

Then, [USDC token contract has a blacklist that is operated by Circle](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2020/07/08/circle-confirms-freezing-100k-in-usdc-at-law-enforcements-request/). Once some address would be blacklisted by the USDC token contract, the address can not send (transfer) their USDC.

However, within both the AccountFacet#`transferAllocation()`and the AccountFacetImpl#`transferAllocation()`, there is no input validation to check whether or not both addresses (`origin` and `recipient`) would be a blacklisted-address by USDC contract. 

This allow a blacklisted-user by USDC token contract to utilize the AccountFacet#`transferAllocation()` in order to bypass the restriction by the USDC contract. Because, although the blacklisted-address can not transfer USDC, the account of the same address on the Symmetrical protocol can still transfer USDC to another account (address) in the form of allocation via the AccountFacet#`transferAllocation()` .
And therefore, a user can transfer the amount from their blacklisted address to their another non-blacklisted address via the AccountFacet#`transferAllocation()` on the Symmetrical protocol and then they can withdraw USDC from the account of non-blacklisted address.

**Example scenario** :
(NOTEï¼šAssuming that a same user use 2 different wallet address. Let's say addressA and addressB)
1: A user deposit USDC from addressA into the AccountFacet contract via the AccountFacet#`deposit()`.
2: The user allocate the amount from the account of addressA based on their deposited-amount of USDC.
3: After that, the user's wallet addressA is blacklisted by the USDC contract.
4: The user deposit USDC from addressB into the AccountFacet contract via the AccountFacet#`deposit()`.
5: The user send all amount to the account of addressB, which is non-blacklisted address by USDC contract, in the form of allocation by calling the AccountFacet#`transferAllocation()`.
6: After that, the user deallocate the received-amount in the form of allocation from the account of addressB  and withdraw them (USDC) from the account of addressB to the addressB (which is non-blacklisted address by USDC contract). 


## Impact
A user, who is blacklisted by USDC token contract, can bypass the restriction of USDC token by using their another address (account) and AccountFacet#`transferAllocation()` function, which lead to that the user can transfer the amount in the form of allocation and withdraw USDC

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Within the AccountFacet#`transferAllocation()`, consider adding an input validation in order to check whether or not both addresses the `origin` and the `recipient` assigned would be a blacklisted-address by the USDC token contract.
