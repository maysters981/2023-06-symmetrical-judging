# `depositAndAllocateForPartyB` allocates the wrong amount

## Summary

`depositAndAllocateForPartyB` does not convert the amount deposited to 18 decimals format before allocating it, which results in allocating the wrong amount of collateral to `partyA`.

## Vulnerability Detail

`AccountFacet.sol:depositAndAllocateForPartyB` deposits `amount` of collateral for `msg.sender` and allocates it to `partyA`. However it is not taken into account that `AccountFacetImpl.sol:depositForPartyB` takes the amount with `collateral` decimals and converts it to 18 decimals, so `AccountFacetImpl.sol:allocateForPartyB` takes the amount with 18 decimals. This results in allocating the wrong amount of collateral to `partyA`.

As the protocol is meant to work with `USDC` and `USDT`, which have 6 decimals, the amount allocated to `partyA` will be 12 orders of magnitude lower than expected.

The logic is analogous to the `deposit` function, which is [implemented correctly](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/Account/AccountFacetImpl.sol#L22-L23).

## Impact

The amount allocated to `partyA` will be lower than the user expected, which could result in the user missing potential profits.

## Recommendation

```diff
    function depositAndAllocateForPartyB(
        uint256 amount,
        address partyA
    ) external whenNotPartyBActionsPaused onlyPartyB {
        AccountFacetImpl.depositForPartyB(amount);
+       uint256 amountWith18Decimals = (amount * 1e18) /
+           (10 ** IERC20Metadata(GlobalAppStorage.layout().collateral).decimals());
-       AccountFacetImpl.allocateForPartyB(amount, partyA, true);
+       AccountFacetImpl.allocateForPartyB(amountWith18Decimals, partyA, true);
        emit DepositForPartyB(msg.sender, amount);
-       emit AllocateForPartyB(msg.sender, partyA, amount);
+       emit AllocateForPartyB(msg.sender, partyA, amountWith18Decimals);
    }
