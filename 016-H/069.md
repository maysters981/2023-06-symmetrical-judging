# Malicious Party B is able to permanently prevent force closing a position by partially closing dust amounts.

## Summary
Malicious Party B is able to prevent force closing a position by partially closing dust amounts.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function forceClosePosition was made incase a Party A request to close a position, but Party B is malicious and doesn't respond. In the end after the force time cooldown runs out, the function forceClosePosition can be called to forcely close the  given amount of quantity from the open position.

However this can be easy exploited by Party B, if we look over the function forceClosePosition we can see that one of the main requirements is for the cooldown to be reached which is mainly based on the quote.modifyTimestamp while the other important requirement is for the quote to be a LIMIT order.

MARKET - requires all of the quantity to be closed
LIMIT - can be partially closed

Since the MARKET order is restricted from force closing the position, the only way would be to set the order type as LIMIT which is exploitable by Malicious Party B.

- PartyA requests MARKET order close
- PartyB doesn't respond (malicious)
- Market close expires (can't be force closed as a position)

- PartyA requests a LIMIT order close
- PartyB (malicious) partially closes dust amounts in order to reset the quote.modifyTimestamp to the current block.timestamp

In the end Party A doesn't have a way to close the position.

The first thing the function does when closing a Quote is to update the quote.modifyTimestamp to the current block.timestamp. Therefore Malicious Party B is able to permanently prevent force closing a position by partially closing dust amounts.

## Impact
A malicious Party B is able to permanently prevent a force closing a position by partially closing dust amounts to reset the quote.modifyTimestamp.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A mofifyTimestamp of a quote should be updated only when the quantityToClose equals zero, otherwise Party B can take advantage of this issue.

```solidity
        if (quote.closedAmount == quote.quantity) {
            quote.quoteStatus = QuoteStatus.CLOSED;
            quote.requestedClosePrice = 0;
            removeFromOpenPositions(quote.id);
            quoteLayout.partyAPositionsCount[quote.partyA] -= 1;
            quoteLayout.partyBPositionsCount[quote.partyB][quote.partyA] -= 1;
        } else if (
            quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.CANCEL_CLOSE_PENDING || quote.quantityToClose == 0
        ) {
            quote.quoteStatus = QuoteStatus.OPENED;
            quote.requestedClosePrice = 0;
            quote.quantityToClose = 0; // for CANCEL_CLOSE_PENDING status
+           quote.modifyTimestamp = block.timestamp;
        } else {
            require(
                quote.lockedValues.total() >=
                    SymbolStorage.layout().symbols[quote.symbolId].minAcceptableQuoteValue,
                "LibQuote: Remaining quote value is low"
            );
        }
    }

```
