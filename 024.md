# PartyB can withdraw funds if it got suspended.

## Summary

Contract `Accessibility.sol` contains `notSuspended` modifier. Its aim is to prevent the withdrawal of funds by suspended users.

But partyB can find a way to withdraw funds from the app even if it was suspended.

## Vulnerability Detail

`notSuspended` modifier checks only the withdraw function, but the suspended user can perform other operations, like filling orders.

Imagine PartyB noticed that it's suspended and can't withdraw funds. It can create a partyA user, and send the quote with the amount of tokens that can be filled by PartyB (the same person) with a very high (in case of a long position) price in order to drain PartyB's balance. 

After that, PartyA can withdraw previous PartyB's funds.

I understand that there is a cooldown period:  maLayout.deallocateCooldown = 300; but 5 minutes can be enough and it's still a way to bypass `notSuspended` modifier.


## Impact

Bypassing withdrawal modifiers can lead to the loss of funds that should stay in the system for some reason.

## Code Snippet

To demonstrate it I took a part from `ClosePosition.behavior.ts` test: 

    it.only("Should run successfully for market", async function () {
      const context: RunContext = this.context;
      const hedgerSus = context.signers.hedger.getAddress();
      await context.controlFacet.connect(context.signers.admin).setSuspendedAddress(hedgerSus, true); //we suspend PartyB
      let closePrice = decimal(41, 17); // previous closePrice was 11e17, so I changed it to 41e17 in order to drain a PartyB's balance without otherchanges
      const validator = new FillCloseRequestValidator();
      const beforeOut = await validator.before(context, {
        user: this.user,
        hedger: this.hedger,
        quoteId: BigNumber.from(4),
      });
      const filledAmount = await getQuoteQuantity(context, 4);
      await this.hedger.fillCloseRequest(
        4,
        marketFillCloseRequestBuilder().filledAmount(filledAmount).closedPrice(closePrice).build(),
      );
      await validator.after(context, {
        user: this.user,
        hedger: this.hedger,
        quoteId: BigNumber.from(4),
        closePrice: closePrice,
        filledAmount: filledAmount,
        beforeOutput: beforeOut,
      });
    });

As a result, we can see the following balances: 

    accountLayout.allocatedBalances[quote.partyA] 806000000000000000000
    accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][quote.partyA] 50000000000000000000
    accountLayout.allocatedBalances[quote.partyB] 0

The funds moved from PartyB to PartyA and PartyA can withdraw them.

I used the current quotes and user balances from the Test files in order to show a simple example. But irl a new PartyA user should be created by PartyB.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

As I understand from our dialog with one of the developers in Discord any user can become a PartyA, but in order to become a PartyB you need to get approval. At the same time, they plan that in the future anyone will be able to become a PartyB. In this case, suspended PartyA will be able to make the same fake operations with created PartyB.

If `notSuspended` modifier is necessary for an app it should be added to all operations that allow interactions between PartA and PartyB to prevent the flow of funds between different accounts.
