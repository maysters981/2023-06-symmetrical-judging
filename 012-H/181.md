# `partyA` can inflate the uPnL with no cost

## Summary

`partyA` can inflate the uPnL with no cost by opening a long position of order type limit with an `openedPrice` of 0, using a `partyB` account that is also controlled by `partyA`.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `PartyBFacetImpl:openPosition` function, when the position type is long there is no minimum for the `openedPrice`. Also, if the `openedPrice` is lower than the `requestedOpenPrice`, the proportional locked values are unlocked. This means that for a long position of order type limit party B can send an `openedPrice` of 0 and result in no locked values.

This could be done by a partyA to inflate the uPnL with no cost. See the following example:

1. Party A creates a quote with the following parameters:
    - partyBsWhiteList: [bob]
    - positionType: LONG
    - orderType: LIMIT
    - price: 100e18
    - quantity: 1e18
    - cva: 22e18,
    - mm: 75e18
    - lf: 3e18

2. Party A also controls the bob account and uses it to open a position with the following parameters:
    - filledAmount: 1e18
    - requestedOpenPrice: 0

3. As a result, there is no locked values and the uPnL of party A is inflated by `(currentPrice - 0) * 1e18`.

This temporary inflation of the uPnL will be corrected when party B is liquidated. However, there are two things to consider:
- There is no incentive for liquidators to liquidate the position, since the liquidation fee is 0. So it will have to be done by the liquidator bot.
- There is a liquidation timeout that will delay the liquidation process. Currently this value is set to 1 day in the Fantom mainnet.

Party A can also repeat the process with different accounts to keep the uPnL inflated.

## Impact

Party A can inflate the uPnL with no cost, which could be used to avoid liquidations and wait until the prices on other positions are favorable.

## Recommendation

A possible solution would be checking that the `openedPrice` is inside a certain range.
