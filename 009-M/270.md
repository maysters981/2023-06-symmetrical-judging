# Changing the collateral can break the protocol

## Summary
The `ControlFacet.setCollateral` function updates the `collateral` token. This sudden change can break the working of protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail
Changing the collateral when the `balances` still stores the amounts deposited of previous collateral token can cause major accounting issue for the protocol and its users.

## Impact
Since the new collateral can have different price or different decimals than the previous collateral token, the balance accounting of the protocol can get severely impacted. Note that even USDC and USDT can have different decimals on same chain.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function setCollateral(
        address collateral
    ) external onlyRole(LibAccessibility.DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
        GlobalAppStorage.layout().collateral = collateral;
        emit SetCollateral(collateral);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider removing the `setCollateral` so that collateral can only be set at deployment/initialization.
