# Collateral balance may be insufficient

## Summary
Users can withdraw tokens as collateral, but the type of token can be changed at any time by the management.
After the change, users who deposited with tokens before the change will not be able to withdraw them, as the contract may not have enough tokens outstanding after the change.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `withdraw` function of `AccountFacetImpl`, collateral can be withdrawn by `IERC20(appLayout.collateral).safeTransfer(user, amount);`.
However, since `appLayout.collateral` can be changed at any time by `setCollateral`, there is a possibility that a user may not be able to withdraw due to insufficient balance after the change.
## Impact
Users have their funds frozen.
