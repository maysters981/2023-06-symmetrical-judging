# LiquidationFacetImpl.liquidatePartyB should call returnTradingFee to return the trading fee to PartyA when processing the quote whose status is LOCKED/CANCEL_PENDING

## Summary

- When a quote is created by PartyA, PartyA pays the trading fee to feeCollector.
- When a quote is canceled, the trading fee will be returned to PartyA.
- When a quote is opened, the trading fee will no longer be returned.

The above follows the design of the protocol.

However, after PartyB locks one quote created by PartyA, because PartyB is liquidated, the status of the locked quote will be set to `QuoteStatus.LIQUIDATED`. **It will be useless and no longer be opened by other PartyB, so the trading fee for this quote should be returned to PartyA**.

## Vulnerability Detail

`LiquidationFacetImpl.liquidatePartyB` will loop through each quote in the `quoteLayout.partyAPendingQuotes[partyA]` array. If `quote.partyB` is the liquidated PartyB and `quote.quoteStatus` is equal to `LOCKED` or `CANCEL_PENDING`, then this quote will be set to `LIQUIDATED` and removed from the array.

279:             Quote storage quote = quoteLayout.quotes[pendingQuotes[index]];
280:             if (
281:                 quote.partyB == partyB &&
282:                 (quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.LOCKED ||
283:                     quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.CANCEL_PENDING)
284:             ) {
285:                 accountLayout.pendingLockedBalances[partyA].subQuote(quote);
286:->               //@audit-issue lacks LibQuote.returnTradingFee(quote.id)
287:                 pendingQuotes[index] = pendingQuotes[pendingQuotes.length - 1];
288:                 pendingQuotes.pop();
289:->               quote.quoteStatus = QuoteStatus.LIQUIDATED;
290:                 quote.modifyTimestamp = block.timestamp;
291:             } else {
292:                 index++;
293:             }
294:         }
```

**PartyB is liquidated, and the quote locked by PartyB will be removed. The trading fee is paid by PartyA, so it needs to be returned to PartyA**.

## Impact

PartyA will lose trading fees in the above situation.
