# Fees are not returned for locked or cancel_pending quote, when partyB is liquidated

## Summary
Fees are not returned for locked or cancel_pending quote, when partyB is liquidated.
## Vulnerability Detail
When partyB is liquidated, then all quotes that are in locked or cancel_pending state are set [to liquidated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/liquidation/LiquidationFacetImpl.sol#L288). Note, that they didn't receive fees repayment.

And there is no ability for them to [expire quote](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacet.sol#L64), because [liquidated state is not allowed to expire](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibQuote.sol#L216-L223).

As result their quote, that was not executed is liquidated and they didn't receive fees refund.
