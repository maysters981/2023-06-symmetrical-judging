# Allowing a suspended PartyA to force close positions is against design decision and brings risk

## Summary

A suspended PartyA is able to close his/her positions by calling `forceClosePosition(...)` method, this is against design decision and may bring risk.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a PartyA requests to close a position, the request might be ignored by a unresponding PartyB and user's funds is stucked. To prevent this situation from happening, PartyA can call [forceClosePosition(...)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacet.sol#L152-L169) method to force close the position and get funds back.
```solidity
    function forceClosePosition(uint256 quoteId, PairUpnlAndPriceSig memory upnlSig)
        external
        notLiquidated(quoteId)
        whenNotPartyAActionsPaused
    {
        Quote storage quote = QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId];
        uint256 filledAmount = quote.quantityToClose;
        uint256 requestedClosePrice = quote.requestedClosePrice;
        PartyAFacetImpl.forceClosePosition(quoteId, upnlSig);
        emit ForceClosePosition(
            quoteId,
            quote.partyA,
            quote.partyB,
            filledAmount,
            requestedClosePrice,
            quote.quoteStatus
        );
    }
```
We can see from the code that this method could be called by anyone, including a suspended PartyA. 

As confirmed with sponsor, suspended partyAs are not allowed to do anything to their positions, however, this can be bypassed by simply calling `forceClosePosition` method and positions are thus closed by a suspended PartyA.

## Impact

- Allowing a suspended PartyA to force close positions is against the design decision
- Allowing a suspended PartyA to force close suspicious positions may result in more ill-gotten gains and make things worse.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Should not allow a PartyA to call [forceClosePosition(...)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacet.sol#L152-L169):
```diff
    function forceClosePosition(uint256 quoteId, PairUpnlAndPriceSig memory upnlSig)
        external

        notLiquidated(quoteId)
        whenNotPartyAActionsPaused

        ...
