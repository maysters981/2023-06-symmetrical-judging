# Suspended partyB users can transfer their funds to not suspended partyA to withdraw them

## Summary
Suspended partyB users can transfer their funds to not suspended partyA (can be account under their control) to withdraw them 
## Vulnerability Detail
Bolth methods for withdraw and even the one for opening a quote (`sendQuote()`) have a modifier [`notSuspended(msg.sender)`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/utils/Accessibility.sol#L73-L79), this modifier is preventing suspended  users from withdrawing any balances from the system. However there is no check on partyB side if this user is suspended, thus allowing suspended partyB users to create partyA account and trade for loss on B side, to transfer the funds to A side.

Example(it's quite long):

B is suspended and wants to withdraw his money from the system, so he creates A account to help him with the task.

**A:** opens up a  LIMIT SHORT position on BTC for 30k (current price is 25k), this guaranties immediate wins for A, he also sets  `partyBsWhiteList` to his B address and finnaly sets lf, mm, cva to approparete parameters for such a trade, all other parameters are irelevant

```jsx
    function sendQuote(
        address[] memory partyBsWhiteList,// his B address
        uint256 symbolId, //BTC/USD
        PositionType positionType, //SHORT
        OrderType orderType, //LIMIT
        uint256 price, // 30 000e18
        uint256 quantity, //1 BTC 
    ) 
```
**B:** [`lockQuote()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L22-L38) and afterwards calls [`openPosition()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L112-L254) with 
```jsx
    function openPosition(
        uint256 filledAmount,// 100% => 1 BTC => 1e18
        uint256 openedPrice,// A requested price 30 000e18
    )
```
This position passes the important [require](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L137-L140) and [solvency](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibSolvency.sol#L15-L97) checks and afterwards the quote becomes **OPENED**:
```jsx
else {
  require(openedPrice >= quote.requestedOpenPrice,"PartyBFacet: Opened price isn't valid");
}
LibSolvency.isSolventAfterOpenPosition(quoteId, filledAmount, upnlSig);
```
**A:**  calls `requestToClosePosition()` again with the same parameters (I have included the important ones only, the rest are irrelevant):
```jsx
    function requestToClosePosition(
        uint256 closePrice,// same price from beginning  30 000e18
        uint256 quantityToClose,// 1 BTC=> 1e18
        OrderType orderType,// LIMIT
    )
```
**B:** Finally calls [`fillCloseRequest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacetImpl.sol#L256-L293)
```jsx
    function fillCloseRequest(
        uint256 filledAmount, // 100%, 1 BTC => 1e18
        uint256 closedPrice, // 30 000e18
    )
```
The parameters are checked if they match **A**'s request and the quote is [closed](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibQuote.sol#L149-L208). On the close request, profits are calculated and funds are [distributed around](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibQuote.sol#L169-L176):
```jsx
        (bool hasMadeProfit, uint256 pnl) = LibQuote.getValueOfQuoteForPartyA(
            closedPrice,
            filledAmount,
            quote
        );
        if (hasMadeProfit) {
            accountLayout.allocatedBalances[quote.partyA] += pnl;
            accountLayout.partyBAllocatedBalances[quote.partyB][quote.partyA] -= pnl;
        }
```
**NOTE**: Because I was not able to get any values for `upnlSig` the amounts that I used are arbitrary and may be different in real world example, **but the concept remains the same**. Suspended B is not locked from accepting trades from A so it is possible to "transfer" his funds away with the use of trades.

## Impact
Suspended partyB users are able to withdraw their funds thru trades.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
For the fix I suggest to include `notSuspended()` modifier in [`fillCloseRequest()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyB/PartyBFacet.sol#L192), to prevent B from filling out quote requests.
