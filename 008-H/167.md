# Suspended PartyA can still withdraw by leveraging a PartyB under PartyA's control

## Summary

Suspended PartyA can still withdraw by running a PartyB.

## Vulnerability Detail

Suspended PartyA cannot withdraw, as the withdraw method is guarded by notSuspended modifier:
```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 amount) external whenNotAccountingPaused notSuspended(msg.sender)
```
However, PartyA can bypass the guard and withdraw by leveraging a PartyB under PartyA's control.

1. PartyA gets his pending quote locked and opened by PartyB;
2. PartyA closes the position in a way that PartyB earns a profit;
3. As PartyB is not suspended, funds can be deallocated and withdrawn PartyB.

## Impact

Suspended PartyA's funds is withdrawn.
