# Suspended account still can do partyB actions

## Summary
Suspended account still can do partyB actions
## Vulnerability Detail
For any reasons user [can be suspended by protocol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/control/ControlFacet.sol#L304-L310).
This means that he should [not be able to open new quotes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacet.sol#L26), which is handled by `notSuspended` modifier. Also this user can't withdraw collateral.

But currently, all actions of partyB are still available for user, as none of the functions use `notSuspended` modifier. But this user can be partyB as well.
## Impact
Suspended user can use system as partyB.
## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I think that blocking quote and opening position should be restricted for suspended partyB.
