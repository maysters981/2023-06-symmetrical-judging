# Suspended users can deposit can deposit and allocate their balances

## Summary
In the contract, there is a function to suspend users, however suspended users can keep depositing and allocating their balances within the protocol. I believe this is an unexpected outcome as suspended users should not interact with the protocol any more. 

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
//@audit-issue deposit from suspended sender
    //Party A
    function deposit(uint256 amount) external whenNotAccountingPaused {
        AccountFacetImpl.deposit(msg.sender, amount);
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, msg.sender, amount);
    }
//@audit-issue deposit for suspended sender
    function depositFor(address user, uint256 amount) external whenNotAccountingPaused {
        AccountFacetImpl.deposit(user, amount);
        emit Deposit(msg.sender, user, amount);
    }
```
## Impact
Suspended users not fully locked out of the protocol.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I believe that suspended users should be locked out of depositing or depositing for someone else or being deposited for.
