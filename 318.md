# FeeCollector can get ouf WithdrawCooldown in `receiveTradingFees`

## Summary
since `receiveTradingFees` function uses the balance it doesn't need to wait the cooldown
## Vulnerability Detail
1. fee collector can skip the deallocating process because in the code it uses balance instead of allocated 
PartyAs' allocate 1000 units of tokens to `balance` Of the fee collector and then they can just withdraw so its a way for suspended users to clear their balance and get out of that state
2. fee collector can cause most functions in the protocol to revert by subtracting their balance and making that call revert( it can also be not malicious because if the protocol wants some of the profits during the positions some of the calls will revert) 
## Impact
FeeCollector being the attacker and getting out of suspended  and it goes against the spec that users need to wait to withdraw  allocated
## Code Snippet
```solidity
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        uint256 tradingFee = LibQuote.getTradingFee(quoteId);
        accountLayout.allocatedBalances[QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId].partyA] -= tradingFee;
        accountLayout.balances[GlobalAppStorage.layout().feeCollector] += tradingFee;
    }
```
