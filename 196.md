# Updated minimum quote value can make existent close requests stuck

## Summary
Minimum quote value update can hinder a trader's original strategy, resulting in potential risks including the inability to partially close positions and heightened exposure to liquidation.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's suppose the minimum quote value for the ETH symbol is $100, and the current price of ETH is $1900. Alice, a trader, decides to open a LONG, LIMIT trade with exactly $200 worth of locked values. This trade is subsequently locked by another trader, known as partyB. Alice's strategy for this trade is to close half the position when the price of ETH reaches $2000, and the remaining half when the price hits $2200. Consequently, as soon as partyB locks and opens the quote, Alice requests a closure of half of the position at the $2000 ETH price point.

However, a week later, the SETTER updates the minimum quote value for ETH to $300. Given this new restriction, Alice can't close half of the position as she initially planned a week ago. Her only recourse is to wait until the trade's deadline. During this waiting period, Alice faces the risk of liquidation, potentially missing profit opportunities, and could even lose her initial investment to the counterparty.
## Impact
If the deadline set by the trade is a long time, then it means that this trade is stucked. I think this is a decent medium.

## Recommendation
The fix is there actually, https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/libraries/LibQuote.sol#L201-L208
this line is redundant, since before the close request made by partyA, the code already checked the remainder of the quote value whether its higher or lesser than the quote value. Removing this would make it gas efficient + avoids updated min quote values.
