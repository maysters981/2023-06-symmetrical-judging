# Forcing is not possible due to high cooldown

## Summary
When partyB does not respond to partyA's request, only thing that partyA can do is waiting for some cooldown to pass and then forcing actions. Because this cooldown is very high, it is practically not possible to use these functions.
## Vulnerability Detail
In order for partyA's to call force function they need to wait some cooldown to pass, for example [forceCancelQuote](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/PartyA/PartyAFacetImpl.sol/#L209-L218)
```solidity
    function forceCancelQuote(uint256 quoteId) internal {
        AccountStorage.Layout storage accountLayout = AccountStorage.layout();
        MAStorage.Layout storage maLayout = MAStorage.layout();
        Quote storage quote = QuoteStorage.layout().quotes[quoteId];

        require(quote.quoteStatus == QuoteStatus.CANCEL_PENDING, "PartyAFacet: Invalid state");
        require(
            block.timestamp > quote.modifyTimestamp + maLayout.forceCancelCooldown,
            "PartyAFacet: Cooldown not reached"
        );
```
But this cooldown is in default set to "3000000000000000" seconds, which makes these functions practically impossible to use.
## Impact
Protocol's one of main functionality is not usable.
## Code Snippet
[ControlFacet.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-06-symmetrical/blob/main/symmio-core/contracts/facets/control/ControlFacet.sol/#L25-L27)
```solidity
        maLayout.forceCancelCooldown = 3000000000000000;
        maLayout.forceCloseCooldown = 3000000000000000;
        maLayout.forceCancelCloseCooldown = 3000000000000000;
```

## Recommendation
Reduce the default cooldown to a reasonable value.
